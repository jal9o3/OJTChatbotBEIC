PREFACE FOR THE REVISED EDITION

It gives me great pleasure to provide this preface to the revised edition of
A Theory of Justice. Despite many criticisms of the original work, I still
accept its main outlines and defend its central doctrines. Of course, I
wish, as one might expect, that I had done certain things differently, and I
would now make a number of important revisions. But if I were writing A
Theory of Justice over again, I would not write, as authors sometimes say,
a completely different book.

In February and March of 1975 the original English text was consider-
ably revised for the German edition of that year. To the best of my
knowledge these revisions have been included in all subsequent transla-
tions and no further ones have been added since that time. All translations
have, therefore, been made from the same revised text. Since this revised
text includes what I believe are significant improvements, the translated
editions (provided accuracy is preserved) until now have been superior to
the original. This revised edition incorporates these improvements.

Before commenting on the more important revisions and why they
were made, I will comment on the conception of justice presented in A
Theory of Justice, a conception I call “justice as fairness.” The central
ideas and aims of this conception I see as those of a philosophical con-
ception for a constitutional democracy. My hope is that justice as fairness
will seem reasonable and useful, even if not fully convincing, to a wide
range of thoughtful political opinions and thereby express an essential
part of the common core of the democratic tradition.

The central aims and ideas of that conception I refer to in the preface
to the first edition. As I explain in the second and third paragraphs of that
preface, I wanted to work out a conception of justice that provides a
reasonably systematic alternative to utilitarianism, which in one form
or another has long dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political
thought. The primary reason for wanting to find such an alternative is the
weakness, so I think, of utilitarian doctrine as a basis for the institutions

Preface for the Revised Edition

of constitutional democracy. In particular, I do not believe that utilitarian-
ism can provide a satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of
citizens as free and equal persons, a requirement of absolutely first im-
portance for an account of democratic institutions. I used a more general
and abstract rendering of the idea of the social contract by means of the
idea of the original position as a way to do that. A convincing account of
basic rights and liberties, and of their priority, was the first objective of
justice as fairness. A second objective was to integrate that account with
an understanding of democratic equality, which led to the principle of fair
equality of opportunity and the difference principle.

In the revisions I made in 1975 I removed certain weaknesses in the
original edition. These I shall now try to indicate, although I am afraid
much of what I say will not be intelligible without some prior knowledge
of the text. Leaving this concern aside, one of the most serious weak-
nesses was in the account of liberty, the defects of which were pointed out
by H. L. A. Hart in his critical discussion of 1973.” Beginning with §11, I
made revisions to clear up several of the difficulties Hart noted. It must be
said, however, that the account in the revised text, although considerably
improved, is still not fully satisfactory. A better version is found in a later
essay of 1982 entitled “The Basic Liberties and Their Priority.”’ This
essay attempts to answer what I came to regard as Hart’s most important
objections. The basic rights and liberties and their priority are there said
to guarantee equally for all citizens the social conditions essential for the
adequate development and the full and informed exercise of their two
moral powers—their capacity for a sense of justice and their capacity for
a conception of the good—in what I call the two fundamental cases. Very
briefly, the first fundamental case is the application of the principles of
justice to the basic structure of society by the exercise of citizens’ sense
of justice. The second fundamental case is the application of citizens’
powers of practical reason and thought in forming, revising, and ratio-
nally pursuing their conception of the good. The equal political liberties,
including their fair value (an idea introduced in §36), and freedom of
thought, liberty of conscience, and freedom of association, are to insure

1. For these two principles see §§12—14 of Chapter II. It is these two principles, and particularly
the difference principle, which give justice as fairness its liberal, or social democratic, character.

Preface for the Revised Edition

that the exercise of the moral powers can be free, informed, and effective
in these two cases. These changes in the account of liberty can, I think, fit
comfortably within the framework of justice as fairness as found in the
revised text.

A second serious weakness of the original edition was its account of
primary goods. These were said to be things that rational persons want
whatever else they want, and what these were and why was to be ex-
plained by the account of goodness in Chapter VII. Unhappily that ac-
count left it ambiguous whether something’s being a primary good de-
pends solely on the natural facts of human psychology or whether it also
depends on a moral conception of the person that embodies a certain
ideal. This ambiguity is to be resolved in favor of the latter: persons are to
be viewed as having two moral powers (those mentioned above) and as
having higher-order interests in developing and exercising those powers.
Primary goods are now characterized as what persons need in their status
as free and equal citizens, and as normal and fully cooperating members
of society over a complete life. Interpersonal comparisons for purposes of
political justice are to be made in terms of citizens’ index of primary
goods and these goods are seen as answering to their needs as citizens as
opposed to their preferences and desires. Beginning with §15, I made
revisions to convey this change of view, but these revisions fall short of
the fuller statement I have given since in an essay, published in 1982,
entitled “Social Unity and Primary Goods.”* As with the changes in the
account of the basic liberties, I think the changes required by that state-
ment can be incorporated within the framework of the revised text.

Many other revisions were made, especially in Chapter III and again,
though fewer, in Chapter IV. In Chapter III I simply tried to make the
reasoning clearer and less open to misunderstanding. The revisions are
too numerous to note here, but they do not, I think, depart in any impor-
tant way from the view of the original edition. After Chapter IV there are
few changes. I revised §44 in Chapter V on just savings, again trying to
make it clearer; and I rewrote the first six paragraphs of §82 of Chapter
IX to correct a serious mistake in the argument for the priority of liberty;°
and there are further changes in the rest of that section. Perhaps having
identified what I regard as the two important changes, those in the ac-

Preface for the Revised Edition

counts of the basic liberties and of primary goods, these indications
suffice to convey the nature and extent of the revisions.

If I were writing A Theory of Justice now, there are two things I would
handle differently. One concerns how to present the argument from the
original position (see Chapter III) for the two principles of justice (see
Chapter II). It would have been better to present it in terms of two
comparisons. In the first parties would decide between the two principles
of justice, taken as a unit, and the principle of (average) utility as the sole
principle of justice. In the second comparison, the parties would decide
between the two principles of justice and those same principles but for
one important change: the principle of (average) utility is substituted for
the difference principle. (The two principles after this substitution I called
a mixed conception, and here it is understood that the principle of utility
is to be applied subject to the constraints of the prior principles: the
principle of the equal liberties and the principle of fair equality of oppor-
tunity.) Using these two comparisons has the merit of separating the
arguments for the equal basic liberties and their priority from the argu-
ments for the difference principle itself. The arguments for the equal
basic liberties are at first glance much stronger, as those for the difference
principle involve a more delicate balance of considerations. The primary
aim of justice as fairness is achieved once it is clear that the two princi-
ples would be adopted in the first comparison, or even in a third compari-
son in which the mixed conception of the second comparison is adopted
rather than the principle of utility. I continue to think the difference
principle important and would still make the case for it, taking for granted
(as in the second comparison) an institutional background that satisfies
the two preceding principles. But it is better to recognize that this case is
less evident and is unlikely ever to have the force of the argument for the
two prior principles.

Another revision I would now make is to distinguish more sharply the
idea of a property-owning democracy (introduced in Chapter V) from the
idea of a welfare state.® These ideas are quite different, but since they
both allow private property in productive assets, we may be misled into
thinking them essentially the same. One major difference is that the
background institutions of property-owning democracy, with its system
of (workably) competitive markets, tries to disperse the ownership of
wealth and capital, and thus to prevent a small part of society from

6. The term “property-owning democracy,” as well as some features of the idea, I borrowed from

J.E. Meade, Efficiency, Equality, and the Ownership of Property (London: G. Allen & Unwin, 1964);
see esp. Chapter V.

Preface for the Revised Edition

controlling the economy and indirectly political life itself. Property-own-
ing democracy avoids this, not by redistributing income to those with less
at the end of each period, so to speak, but rather by ensuring the wide-
spread ownership of productive assets and human capital (educated abili-
ties and trained skills) at the beginning of each period; all this against a
background of equal basic liberties and fair equality of opportunity. The
idea is not simply to assist those who lose out through accident or misfor-
tune (although this must be done), but instead to put all citizens in a
position to manage their own affairs and to take part in social cooperation
on a footing of mutual respect under appropriately equal conditions.

Note here two different conceptions of the aim of political institutions
over time. In a welfare state the aim is that none should fall below a
decent standard of life, and that all should receive certain protections
against accident and misfortune—for example, unemployment compen-
sation and medical care. The redistribution of income serves this purpose
when, at the end of each period, those who need assistance can be iden-
tified. Such a system may allow large and inheritable inequities of wealth
incompatible with the fair value of the political liberties (introduced in
§36), as well as large disparities of income that violate the difference
principle. While some effort is made to secure fair equality of opportu-
nity, it is either insufficient or else ineffective given the disparities of
wealth and the political influence they permit.

By contrast, in a property-owning democracy the aim is to carry out
the idea of society as a fair system of cooperation over time among
citizens as free and equal persons. Thus, basic institutions must from the
outset put in the hands of citizens generally, and not only of a few, the
productive means to be fully cooperating members of a society. The
emphasis falls on the steady dispersal over time of the ownership of
capital and resources by the laws of inheritance and bequest, on fair
equality of opportunity secured by provisions for education and training,
and the like, as well as on institutions that support the fair value of the
political liberties. To see the full force of the difference principle it should
be taken in the context of property-owning democracy (or of a liberal
socialist regime) and not a welfare state: it is a principle of reciprocity, or
mutuality, for society seen as a fair system of cooperation among free and
equal citizens from one generation to the next.

The mention (a few lines back) of a liberal socialist regime prompts
me to add that justice as fairness leaves open the question whether its
principles are best realized by some form of property-owning democracy
or by a liberal socialist regime. This question is left to be settled by

historical conditions and the traditions, institutions, and social forces of
each country.’ As a political conception, then, justice, as fairness includes
no natural right of private property in the means of production (although
it does include a right to personal property as necessary for citizens’
independence and integrity), nor a natural right to worker-owned and
-managed firms. It offers instead a conception of justice in the light of
which, given the particular circumstances of a country, those questions

can be reasonably decided.

PREFACE

In presenting a theory of justice I have tried to bring together into one
coherent view the ideas expressed in the papers I have written over the
past dozen years or so. All of the central topics of these essays are taken
up again, usually in considerably more detail. The further questions re-
quired to round out the theory are also discussed. The exposition falls into
three parts. The first part covers with much greater elaboration the same
ground as “Justice as Fairness” (1958) and “Distributive Justice: Some
Addenda” (1968), while the three chapters of the second part correspond
respectively, but with many additions, to the topics of “Constitutional
Liberty” (1963), “Distributive Justice” (1967), and “Civil Disobedience”
(1966). The second chapter of the last part covers the subjects of “The
Sense of Justice” (1963). Except in a few places, the other chapters of this
part do not parallel the published essays. Although the main ideas are
much the same, I have tried to eliminate inconsistencies and to fill out and
strengthen the argument at many points.

Perhaps I can best explain my aim in this book as follows. During
much of modern moral philosophy the predominant systematic theory has
been some form of utilitarianism. One reason for this is that it has been
espoused by a long line of brilliant writers who have built up a body of
thought truly impressive in its scope and refinement. We sometimes for-
get that the great utilitarians, Hume and Adam Smith, Bentham and Mill,
were social theorists and economists of the first rank; and the moral
doctrine they worked out was framed to meet the needs of their wider
interests and to fit into a comprehensive scheme. Those who criticized
them often did so on a much narrower front. They pointed out the obscu-
rities of the principle of utility and noted the apparent incongruities be-
tween many of its implications and our moral sentiments. But they failed,
I believe, to construct a workable and systematic moral conception to
oppose it. The outcome is that we often seem forced to choose between
utilitarianism and intuitionism. Most likely we finally settle upon a vari-

xvii

Preface

ant of the utility principle circumscribed and restricted in certain ad hoc
ways by intuitionistic constraints. Such a view is not irrational; and there
is no assurance that we can do better. But this is no reason not to try.

What I have attempted to do is to generalize and carry to a higher order
of abstraction the traditional theory of the social contract as represented
by Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. In this way I hope that the theory can be
developed so that it is no longer open to the more obvious objections
often thought fatal to it. Moreover, this theory seems to offer an alterna-
tive systematic account of justice that is superior, or so I argue, to the
dominant utilitarianism of the tradition. The theory that results is highly
Kantian in nature. Indeed, I must disclaim any originality for the views I
put forward. The leading ideas are classical and well known. My inten-
tion has been to organize them into a general framework by using certain
simplifying devices so that their full force can be appreciated. My ambi-
tions for the book will be completely realized if it enables one to see more
clearly the chief structural features of the alternative conception of justice
that is implicit in the contract tradition and points the way to its further
elaboration. Of the traditional views, it is this conception, I believe,
which best approximates our considered judgments of justice and consti-
tutes the most appropriate moral basis for a democratic society.

This is a long book, not only in pages. Therefore, to make things easier
for the reader, a few remarks by way of guidance. The fundamental
intuitive ideas of the theory of justice are presented in §§ 1-4 of Chapter I.
From here it is possible to go directly to the discussion of the two
principles of justice for institutions in §§11—17 of Chapter II, and then to
the account of the original position in Chapter III, the whole chapter. A
glance at §8 on the priority problem may prove necessary if this notion is
unfamiliar. Next, parts of Chapter IV, §§33-35 on equal liberty and §§39-
40 on the meaning of the priority of liberty and the Kantian interpreta-
tion, give the best picture of the doctrine. So far this is about a third of the
whole and comprises most of the essentials of the theory.

There is a danger, however, that without consideration of the argument
of the last part, the theory of justice will be misunderstood. In particular,
the following sections should be emphasized: §§66—67 of Chapter VII on
moral worth and self-respect and related notions; §77 of Chapter VIII on
the basis of equality; and §§78—79 on autonomy and social union, §82 on
the priority of liberty, and §§85-86 on the unity of the self and congru-
ence, all in Chapter IX. Adding these sections to the others still comes to
considerably less than half the text.

Preface

The section headings, the remarks that preface each chapter, and the
index will guide the reader to the contents of the book. It seems superflu-
ous to comment on this except to say that I have avoided extensive
methodological discussions. There is a brief consideration of the nature
of moral theory in §9, and of justification in §4 and §87. A short digres-
sion on the meaning of “good” is found in §62. Occasionally there are
methodological comments and asides, but for the most part I try to work
out a substantive theory of justice. Comparisons and contrasts with other
theories, and criticisms thereof now and then, especially of utilitarianism,
are viewed as means to this end.

By not including most of Chapters IV—VIII in the more basic parts of
the book, I do not mean to suggest that these chapters are peripheral, or
merely applications. Rather, I believe that an important test of a theory of
justice is how well it introduces order and system into our considered
judgments over a wide range of questions. Therefore the topics of these
chapters need to be taken up, and the conclusions reached modify in turn
the view proposed. But in this regard the reader is more free to follow his
preferences and to look at the problems which most concern him.

In writing this book I have acquired many debts in addition to those
indicated in the text. Some of these I should like to acknowledge here.
Three different versions of the manuscript have passed among students
and colleagues, and I have benefited beyond estimation from the innu-
merable suggestions and criticisms that I have received. I am grateful to
Allan Gibbard for his criticism of the first version (1964-1965). To meet
his objections to the veil of ignorance as then presented, it seemed neces-
sary to include a theory of the good. The notion of primary goods based
on the conception discussed in Chapter VII is the result. I also owe him
thanks, along with Norman Daniels, for pointing out difficulties with my
account of utilitarianism as a basis for individual duties and obligations.
Their objections led me to eliminate much of this topic and to simplify
the treatment of this part of the theory. David Diamond objected force-
fully to my discussion of equality, particularly to its failure to consider
the relevance of status. I eventually included an account of self-respect as
a primary good to try to deal with this and other questions, including
those of society as a social union of social unions and the priority of
liberty. I had profitable discussions with David Richards on the problems
of political duty and obligation. Although supererogation is not a central
topic of the book, I have been helped in my comments on it by Barry

Curtis and John Troyer; even so they may still object to what I say.
Thanks should also go to Michael Gardner and Jane English for several
corrections which I managed to make in the final text.

I have been fortunate in receiving valuable criticisms from persons
who have discussed the essays in print.' I am indebted to Brian Barry,
Michael Lessnoff, and R. P. Wolff for their discussions of the formulation
of and the argument for the two principles of justice.” Where I have not
accepted their conclusions I have had to amplify the argument to meet
their objections. I hope the theory as now presented is no longer open to
the difficulties they raised, nor to those urged by John Chapman.’ The
relation between the two principles of justice and what I call the general
conception of justice is similar to that proposed by S. I. Benn.’ I am
grateful to him, and to Lawrence Stern and Scott Boorman, for sugges-
tions in this direction. The substance of Norman Care’s criticisms of the
conception of moral theory found in the essays seems sound to me, and
I have tried to develop the theory of justice so that it avoids his objec-
tions.’ In doing this, I have learned from Burton Dreben, who made W. V.
Quine’s view clear to me and persuaded me that the notions of meaning
and analyticity play no essential role in moral theory as I conceive of it.
Their relevance for other philosophical questions need not be disputed
here one way or the other; but I have tried to make the theory of justice

independent of them. Thus I have followed with some modifications the
point of view of my “Outline for Ethics.”° I should also like to thank
A. K. Sen for his searching discussion and criticisms of the theory of
justice.’ These have enabled me to improve the presentation at various
places. His book will prove indispensable to philosophers who wish to
study the more formal theory of social choice as economists think of it.
At the same time, the philosophical problems receive careful treatment.

Many persons have volunteered written comments on the several ver-
sions of the manuscript. Gilbert Harman’s on the earliest one were funda-
mental and forced me to abandon a number of views and to make basic
changes at many points. I received others while at the Philosophical
Institute at Boulder (summer 1966), from Leonard Krimerman, Richard
Lee, and Huntington Terrell; and from Terrell again later. I have tried to
accommodate to these, and to the very extensive and instructive com-
ments of Charles Fried, Robert Nozick, and J. N. Shklar, each of whom
has been of great help throughout. In developing the account of the good,
I have gained much from J. M. Cooper, T. M. Scanlon, and A. T. Ty-
moczko, and from discussions over many years with Thomas Nagel, to
whom I am also indebted for clarification about the relation between the
theory of justice and utilitarianism. I must also thank R. B. Brandt and
Joshua Rabinowitz for their many useful ideas for improvements in the
second manuscript (1967-1968), and B. J. Diggs, J. C. Harsanyi, and
W. G. Runciman for illuminating correspondence.

During the writing of the third version (1969-1970), Brandt, Tracy
Kendler, E. S. Phelps, and Amélie Rorty were a constant source of ad-
vice, and their criticisms were of great assistance. On this manuscript I
received many valuable comments and suggestions for changes from
Herbert Morris, and from Lessnoff and Nozick; these have saved me from
a number of lapses and have made the book much better. I am particularly
grateful to Nozick for his unfailing help and encouragement during the
last stages. Regrettably I have not been able to deal with all criticisms
received, and I am well aware of the faults that remain; but the measure of
my debt is not the shortfall from what might be but the distance traveled
from the beginnings.

The Center for Advanced Study at Stanford provided the ideal place
for me to complete my work. I should like to express my deep apprecia-

CHAPTER I. JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS

In this introductory chapter I sketch some of the main ideas of the theory
of justice I wish to develop. The exposition is informal and intended to
prepare the way for the more detailed arguments that follow. Unavoidably
there is some overlap between this and later discussions. I begin by
describing the role of justice in social cooperation and with a brief ac-
count of the primary subject of justice, the basic structure of society. I
then present the main idea of justice as fairness, a theory of justice that
generalizes and carries to a higher level of abstraction the traditional
conception of the social contract. The compact of society is replaced by
an initial situation that incorporates certain procedural constraints on
arguments designed to lead to an original agreement on principles of
justice. I also take up, for purposes of clarification and contrast, the
classical utilitarian and intuitionist conceptions of justice and consider
some of the differences between these views and justice as fairness. My
guiding aim is to work out a theory of justice that is a viable alternative to
these doctrines which have long dominated our philosophical tradition.

1. THE ROLE OF JUSTICE

Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of
thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or
revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how effi-
cient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.
Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the
welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice
denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good
shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few
are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. There-
fore in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled;

Justice as Fairness

the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to
the calculus of social interests. The only thing that permits us to acqui-
esce in an erroneous theory is the lack of a better one; analogously, an
injustice is tolerable only when it is necessary to avoid an even greater
injustice. Being first virtues of human activities, truth and justice are
uncompromising.

These propositions seem to express our intuitive conviction of the
primacy of justice. No doubt they are expressed too strongly. In any event
I wish to inquire whether these contentions or others similar to them are
sound, and if so how they can be accounted for. To this end it is necessary
to work out a theory of justice in the light of which these assertions can
be interpreted and assessed. I shall begin by considering the role of the
principles of justice. Let us assume, to fix ideas, that a society is a more
or less self-sufficient association of persons who in their relations to one
another recognize certain rules of conduct as binding and who for the
most part act in accordance with them. Suppose further that these rules
specify a system of cooperation designed to advance the good of those
taking part in it. Then, although a society is a cooperative venture for
mutual advantage, it is typically marked by a conflict as well as by an
identity of interests. There is an identity of interests since social coopera-
tion makes possible a better life for all than any would have if each were
to live solely by his own efforts. There is a conflict of interests since
persons are not indifferent as to how the greater benefits produced by
their collaboration are distributed, for in order to pursue their ends they
each prefer a larger to a lesser share. A set of principles is required for
choosing among the various social arrangements which determine this
division of advantages and for underwriting an agreement on the proper
distributive shares. These principles are the principles of social justice:
they provide a way of assigning rights and duties in the basic institutions
of society and they define the appropriate distribution of the benefits and
burdens of social cooperation.

Now let us say that a society is well-ordered when it is not only
designed to advance the good of its members but when it is also effec-
tively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in
which (1) everyone accepts and knows that the others accept the same
principles of justice, and (2) the basic social institutions generally satisfy
and are generally known to satisfy these principles. In this case while
men may put forth excessive demands on one another, they nevertheless
acknowledge a common point of view from which their claims may be
adjudicated. If men’s inclination to self-interest makes their vigilance

1. The Role of Justice

against one another necessary, their public sense of justice makes their
secure association together possible. Among individuals with disparate
aims and purposes a shared conception of justice establishes the bonds of
civic friendship; the general desire for justice limits the pursuit of other
ends. One may think of a public conception of justice as constituting the
fundamental charter of a well-ordered human association.

Existing societies are of course seldom well-ordered in this sense, for
what is just and unjust is usually in dispute. Men disagree about which
principles should define the basic terms of their association. Yet we may
still say, despite this disagreement, that they each have a conception of
justice. That is, they understand the need for, and they are prepared to
affirm, a characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and
duties and for determining what they take to be the proper distribution of
the benefits and burdens of social cooperation. Thus it seems natural to
think of the concept of justice as distinct from the various conceptions of
justice and as being specified by the role which these different sets of
principles, these different conceptions, have in common.' Those who hold
different conceptions of justice can, then, still agree that institutions are
just when no arbitrary distinctions are made between persons in the
assigning of basic rights and duties and when the rules determine a proper
balance between competing claims to the advantages of social life. Men
can agree to this description of just institutions since the notions of an
arbitrary distinction and of a proper balance, which are included in the
concept of justice, are left open for each to interpret according to the
principles of justice that he accepts. These principles single out which
similarities and differences among persons are relevant in determining
rights and duties and they specify which division of advantages is appro-
priate. Clearly this distinction between the concept and the various con-
ceptions of justice settles no important questions. It simply helps to
identify the role of the principles of social justice.

Some measure of agreement in conceptions of justice is, however, not
the only prerequisite for a viable human community. There are other
fundamental social problems, in particular those of coordination, effici-
ency, and stability. Thus the plans of individuals need to be fitted together
so that their activities are compatible with one another and they can all be
carried through without anyone’s legitimate expectations being severely
disappointed. Moreover, the execution of these plans should lead to the

159.

Justice as Fairness

achievement of social ends in ways that are efficient and consistent with
justice. And finally, the scheme of social cooperation must be stable: it
must be more or less regularly complied with and its basic rules willingly
acted upon; and when infractions occur, stabilizing forces should exist
that prevent further violations and tend to restore the arrangement. Now it
is evident that these three problems are connected with that of justice.
In the absence of a certain measure of agreement on what is just and
unjust, it is clearly more difficult for individuals to coordinate their plans
efficiently in order to insure that mutually beneficial arrangements are
maintained. Distrust and resentment corrode the ties of civility, and suspi-
cion and hostility tempt men to act in ways they would otherwise avoid.
So while the distinctive role of conceptions of justice is to specify basic
rights and duties and to determine the appropriate distributive shares, the
way in which a conception does this is bound to affect the problems of
efficiency, coordination, and stability. We cannot, in general, assess a
conception of justice by its distributive role alone, however useful this
role may be in identifying the concept of justice. We must take into
account its wider connections; for even though justice has a certain prior-
ity, being the most important virtue of institutions, it is still true that,
other things equal, one conception of justice is preferable to another when
its broader consequences are more desirable.

2. THE SUBJECT OF JUSTICE

Many different kinds of things are said to be just and unjust: not only
laws, institutions, and social systems, but also particular actions of many
kinds, including decisions, judgments, and imputations. We also call the
attitudes and dispositions of persons, and persons themselves, just and
unjust. Our topic, however, is that of social justice. For us the primary
subject of justice is the basic structure of society, or more exactly, the way
in which the major social institutions distribute fundamental rights and
duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation.
By major institutions I understand the political constitution and the prin-
cipal economic and social arrangements. Thus the legal protection of
freedom of thought and liberty of conscience, competitive markets, pri-
vate property in the means of production, and the monogamous family
are examples of major social institutions. Taken together as one scheme,
the major institutions define men’s rights and duties and influence their
life prospects, what they can expect to be and how well they can hope to

2. The Subject of Justice

do. The basic structure is the primary subject of justice because its effects
are so profound and present from the start. The intuitive notion here is
that this structure contains various social positions and that men born into
different positions have different expectations of life determined, in part,
by the political system as well as by economic and social circumstances.
In this way the institutions of society favor certain starting places over
others. These are especially deep inequalities. Not only are they perva-
sive, but they affect men’s initial chances in life; yet they cannot possibly
be justified by an appeal to the notions of merit or desert. It is these
inequalities, presumably inevitable in the basic structure of any society, to
which the principles of social justice must in the first instance apply.
These principles, then, regulate the choice of a political constitution and
the main elements of the economic and social system. The justice of a
social scheme depends essentially on how fundamental rights and duties
are assigned and on the economic opportunities and social conditions in
the various sectors of society.

The scope of our inquiry is limited in two ways. First of all, I am
concerned with a special case of the problem of justice. I shall not con-
sider the justice of institutions and social practices generally, nor except
in passing the justice of the law of nations and of relations between
states (§58). Therefore, if one supposes that the concept of justice applies
whenever there is an allotment of something rationally regarded as advan-
tageous or disadvantageous, then we are interested in only one instance of
its application. There is no reason to suppose ahead of time that the
principles satisfactory for the basic structure hold for all cases. These
principles may not work for the rules and practices of private associations
or for those of less comprehensive social groups. They may be irrelevant
for the various informal conventions and customs of everyday life; they
may not elucidate the justice, or perhaps better, the fairness of voluntary
cooperative arrangements or procedures for making contractual agree-
ments. The conditions for the law of nations may require different princi-
ples arrived at in a somewhat different way. I shall be satisfied if it is
possible to formulate a reasonable conception of justice for the basic
structure of society conceived for the time being as a closed system
isolated from other societies. The significance of this special case is
obvious and needs no explanation. It is natural to conjecture that once we
have a sound theory for this case, the remaining problems of justice will
prove more tractable in the light of it. With suitable modifications such a
theory should provide the key for some of these other questions.

The other limitation on our discussion is that for the most part I
