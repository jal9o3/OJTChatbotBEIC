Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for
Sustainable Exploration Activities Case Study PreSalt Brazil

Introduction

Understanding the basin regional trends and identifying the anomalies is a crucial background research
during basin exploration activities . One way to gain a sound knowledge about the geology and the
exploration history is to analyse the vast amount of data accumulated over the years in an unstructured
manner . A sustainable data driven strategy leveraging on the latest advancement of Machine Learning
( ML ) and Analytics is applied on vast amount of unstructured data . By highlighting the data driven
strategy the paper demonstrates such a strategy applied to presalt carbonates prospects located in the
Campos and Santos Basins offshore Brazil . The interpretation framework consists of first step to
identify the regional first order trends and second step to recognize the second order anomalies over
the full area providing a holistic picture of the area of interest .

Methodology

The unstructured data comprise of more than 48000 documents primarily in Portuguese language for
a total of 330000 pages related to 50 years of exploration covering the Campos and Santos Basins . The
methodologies are divided into two parts . In the part one methodology the unstructured data is
processed using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) for name
entity recognition and language translation and Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( DCNN ) for auto
image recognition ( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) . In part two methodology ML Analytics leverages the
visualization for data relationships to give a holistic view of the whole corpus ( Baillard et al . 2021 ) .
Three steps study is used here as explained below with illustration at Figure 1 .

e Step 1 : Deep Search through text is the ability to use keywords search within the whole corpus
and filter the wanted results . Filtered information is easily accessible for investigation . Deep
Search is also applied for images . DCNN image recognition and classification techniques classify
the images into eight categories : thin section core well plot seismic stratigraphic structural
elements map table and figure . A deep search allows user to search information tagged and
identified in these images . This step is to identify the geological and exploration challenges
related to the area of interest .

e Step 2 : Heat Map highlights the hot zones on map based on the frequency of the keywords
found . Drawing a polygon on the map allows user to confine the search to focus only in the zone
of their interest . On the other hand instant text search through the whole corpus of English and
Portuguese documents is possible with the automated translation . Users able to search through
Portuguese documents using English keywords .

e Step 3 : Contextual Knowledge Graph illustrates the connectivity of related corpuses based on
well name referencing . This is useful to obtain related information from different wells
( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) . Besides that Intuition provides clustered images view a great approach
to discover analogues for alike images such as thin section core SEM and biomarker .

Case study : Understanding the PreSalt Carbonate Regional Trends and Anomalies in Campos
and Santos Basins

The Campos and Santos Basins located to the east offshore of Brazil are some of the most prolific oil
and gas basins in the world with significant discoveries such as Tupi Jupiter and Libra Fields . The
investigation of the 50 years of presalt exploration history contained in the 48000 documents processed
revealed that most of the challenges during exploration are caused by 1 . Fluid distribution 2 . The
reservoir quality 3 . CO and H5S presence 4 . Overpressure patterns .

1 . Campos and Santos Basins are showing a variable fluid distribution . The type and quality of
the fluid trends are keys to define the best target for a sustainable development .

2 . The diagenesis affects the reservoir quality . A good visualization of the lateral distribution of
such process allows a better estimation of the porosity and the volume in place .

3 . The regional gas issues such as understanding the presence of CO and HoS is essential to
gauge the reservoir diagenesis properties as well as to plan for production facilities or to avoid
regions of sour and hazardous gaseous .

4 . The irregularity in the thickness of the salt layer causes variability in the pressure regime with
overpressure over the zone of interest and affecting the drilling campaigns .

These challenges are relevant to understand the geology and production issues encountered in distinct
parts of the basins to improve sustainable in the exploration risk and reducing CO footprint .

For the presalt oil trendings Campos presalt generally has lighter oil compared to Santos presalt . As
for the anomalies light oil or condensate discovery at Pau De Acucar Seat and Gavea Fields in Campos
presalt while heavy mostly found in the postsalt in the Southern Campos . In Santos heavy oil reported
in Jupiter Field . Note that heavy oil also discovered in Atlanta and Oliva Fields at postsalt . Illustration
in Figure 2 .

Figure 2 Heat map highlights the wells with heavy oil information . The oil API delineation is based
on Deep Search extraction from test reports for Santos ( left map ) and Campos ( right map ) . Knowledge
Graph was analyzed to find a group of fields that share the light oil information Gavea Seat and Pao
de Acucar Fields .

Next we study the facies distribution at presalt carbonate . A collection of core and thin section images
are retrieved from the Deep Search through images . In general it is observed that the reservoir
formation is in the shrub facies microbiolites and coquina . For the trendingss the area with COo
leaching activities enhance the porosity example in the Libra Buzios Fields going south to Tupi and
Carcara Fields in Santos . Fields proximal to the shore has poorer reservoir quality . One of the anomalies
observed is the hydrothermal activity can destroy the enhanced porosity by the leaching . The
hydrothermal activity is anticipated in Field Albacora Carcara based on the observation on the core .

The following study is to investigate the regional gas issues . The trend is showing that Santos is
suffering higher CO contamination compared to Campos especially in the center deepwater Santos
area . Jupiter Field suffers from very high concentration of CO gas 7946 recorded . Center deeperwater
Santos is suffering from CO ? contamination potentially near to the mantel magmatic activities
intercepted by deepseated fault ( Luca et al . 2017 ) . Hazardous HoS gas presence in high amount
( exceeding OSHA safe limit 50 ppm ) in the Buzios lara Fields of Santos and Xerelete Albacora Fields
of Campos . Illustration in Figure 4 .

Lastly is the study of formation pressure pattern . The formation data points are quickly extracted from
unstructured data over 80 wells using Deep Search . The points are then plotted on gradient psift ranging
from 0.35 to 0.7 psift . Based on the pressure gradient validation wells in Carcara Sagitario and
Corcovado Fields have exceptionally high formation pressure . An interpretation of fullstack PSDM
crosssection shows thick salt area in Carcara and Sagitario possible with faulting causes saline water
intrusion which contribute to high pressure zone . Irregularity in thickness of salt layer causes variability
in pressure regime such as overpressure area to take note as this will have an impact on seismic
interpretation and drilling campaign . Illustration in Figure 5 .

Conclusion

The research shows the effectiveness of using MLAI technologies and Analytics to mine through the
vast amount of unstructured data and gain insights related to the regional trends and anomalies of
important geological reservoir and production parameters to minimize the risk of exploration and
reduce carbon footprint . New tools in MLAI and Analytics provides a new exploration frontier for
subsurface experts allowing them to interrogate and visualize a vast amount of data previously scattered
in different format and location holistically .
