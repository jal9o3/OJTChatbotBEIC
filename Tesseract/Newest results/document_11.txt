WELL SUMMARY

Challis14 was drilled as a development well within the Challis oil field 395m south
west of Challis6 and 1030m east northeast of Challis3 . The proposed total depth of
1674mRT was prognosed to be within the Triassic Pollard Formation of the Sahul
Group .

Challis14 was designed primarily as a new drainage location for the north eastern part
of the Challis horst to develop the C3.23.3 reservoir . The well intersected all
sedimentary sequences as prognosed with only minor depth variances .

Two cores were cut from the interval 1393.6 1423.5mRT at the top of the Challis
Formation with very good recoveries ( 9826 Core1 and 9696 Core2 ) .

A gross hydrocarbon column from 1401 1434.5mRT was intersected extending over .
the C3.23.3 sand and the top two metres of the C4.0 sand . The well has a total net
pay of 22.5m average porosity of 2996 and average water saturation of 3896 .

The well was completed as an oil producer and the rig was released on 5th March
1994

HYDROCARBONS
Hydrocarbon Occumences

There was no direct hydrocarbon fluorescence or significant gas readings in the
Tertiary and Cretaceous sections .

Ditch gas readings rose to about 1096 consisting of C1iC4 over the 1400 1420mRT
section . Below this depth the background gas reduced to between 0.010.295
consisting dominantly of C1 .

Core chips from 1393.6 1423.7mRT show 9010096 bright greenish yellow direct
fluorescence with instant moderately bright yellowish white cut and a solid very bright
yellow residual fluorescence .

Log interpretation ( Appendix N carried out over the interval 1350 1664mRT revealed .
that the C3.2C3.3 sand was encountered five metres lower than prognosed at 1398m
and was 21 metres thick ( cf . prognosed 20m ) . The C4.0 C5.0 CS . 15.2 C6.0 and
Pollard Formation were 8 also intersected by Challis14

An oil water contact is interpreted at 1434.5m intersecting in an upper stringer of the
C4.0 sand . This oil water contact is 2.5m higher than the original field wide contact of
1437m and it is likely that this reservoir unit is hydraulically isolated from the C4.0
perforation in Challis6 ( C4.0 producer ) . 8 The observed rise in the oil water contact is
likely to be due to Challis6 production from the C4.0 sand which is currently
producing with 7596 water cut .

The gross hydrocarbon column ( 1401 1434.5mRT ) extends over the C3.23.3 sand
and into the top two metres of the C4.0 sand with a total net pay of 22.5m average
porosity of 2946 and water saturation of 3896 .

From RFT pretest data ( refer Appendix 2 ) an oil gradient of 1.01 psim was observed
down to 1410.5m . The fluid in the C5.0 C5.15.2 and Pollard sands was shown to be
water with varying degrees of depletion from the original reservoir conditions .
Depletion was greatest in the C4.0 sand mainly due to the fact that Challis6 is closer
to Challis14 than other producers .

No RFT samples were attempted nor was production testing carried out . PLT surveys
carried out show the following results :

( 4 ) a final PI of 70stbpsi was measured

( ii ) 8 temperature logs indicated flow contributions from C3.2C3.3 reservoir at
interval 1403 1409mRT and a stringer sand at 1415 1417mRT

( iii ) 8 gas break out occurred at 1160 1450psia and the likely bubble point pressure
of 1160psia of 64.9C was estimated .

Challis14 intersected a sedimentary sequence ranging in age from Recent to Triassic .
A generalised stratigraphic column for the Challis.field is presented in Figure 2 . The
Actual versus Predicted section is presented in Figure 3 . Delineation of age units is
based on stratigraphic correlation with nearby wells .

. A summary of the lithological sequences intersected is given below . The composite
log ( Enclosure 1 ) contains more detailed age lithology and drilling data . No ditch
cuttings were obtained above 534mRT .

The stratigraphic sequences are discussed in descending order .

No ditch cuttings or open hole wireline logs were obtained above 534mRT ( within
Hibernia Formation ) in this section .

The Hibernia Formation lies unconformably beneath the Oliver Sandstone Member and
is 238m thick . Ditch cuttings indicate the sequence consists of predominantly
yellowish grey moderately hard to hard fine to medium . grained calcarenite with
abundant calcite recrystallisation trace to minor fossiliferous fragments and nil to poor
intergranular or crystalline porosity .

The Jamieson Formation consists mainly of medium grey to medium dark grey
moderately firm claystones with traces of microcrystalline pyrite aggregates
carbonaceous specks and inoceramus .

The top of the unit is marked by a slight increase in GR reading and sonic transit time
and a decrease in resistivity measurement . The underlying disconformity is defined by

The Echuca Shoals claystone is very light grey to light greenish grey mottled
moderately firm with abundant ( up to 7096 ) black fine to coarse pelletal glauconite
traces fine quartz modular pyrite and inoceramus .

The underlying unconformity is defined by a decrease in GR reading a sharp increase
in resistivity reading and a sharp decrease of the sonic transit time ( increase in interval
velocity ) . The base is also marked by the predominantly coarse sandstone of the
Triassic Challis Formation .

TRIASSIC

The Base Cretaceous Unconformity is defined by the boundary of the glauconitic
claystone of the Echuca Shoals and the predominantly coarse grained sandstone of the
Triassic Challis Formation . On the wireline logs it is defined by a sharp decrease in
sonic transit time sharp increase in resistivity measurements and a decrease in GR
reading ( claystone to sandstone lithology ) .

halli rmation
Depth : 1389.5 1572mRT
NN Thickness : 182.5m
Age Carnian

The Challis Formation consists of interbedded claystones and sandstones . The
sandstones are transgressive bar and shoreface sands and are generally light grey to
grey predominantly fine grained moderately well sorted with thin laminations of
micas heavy minerals and carbonaceous material with rare to minor carbonate and
silica cement . The claystone is generally light grey to dusky green motiled
moderately hard with common olive grey to light brown argillaceous material traces
micrite and carbonaceous specks

The top of the Challis Formation is marked by a top of coarse grained sandstone at the
Base Cretaceous Unconformity defined by an increase in resistivity measurement and
sharp decrease in sonic transit time . The base of the Challis Formation is defined from
wireline logs by a sharp decrease of GR reading ( cleaner sands ) and resistivity
measurement and a slight increase in sonic transit time ( slower velocity ) represented by
the deltaic sandstones of the Pollard Formation .

Within the Challis Formation the C3.2C3.3 C4.0 C50 C5.5.2 C6.0 were all
intersected a few meters low to prognosis due to unexpected steep dips .

Pollard Formation

Depth : 1572 1676mRT ( TD )
Thickness : 104m
Age : Ladinian

The Pollard Formation underlies the Challis Formation and consists of mainly clean
thick deltaic sandstones which are fine to medium grained moderately well sorted
weak to occasionally strong siliceous cement and trace thin carbonaceous laminae . The
GR log response indicates cleaner and thicker sands when compared to the overlying
Challis Formation sandstones . This unit was also intersected low to prognosis as a
result of unexpected steep dips .

5 STRUCTURE

The Base Cretaceous Unconformity forming the regional top porosity was intersected
3m deep to prognosis at 1368mSS . Although the target C3.23.3 unit was intersected
5m deep to prognosis the 9m sand thickness of the unit was close to the 10m
predicted . Below the Base Cretaceoous Unconformity the beds had unexpected high
dips resulting in the reservoir units being intersected low to . prognosis .

The structure of the C3.23.3 unit westsouthwest of the well is the main control for
the volume of oilinplace . There is some postdrill uncertainty in the form the base of
the unit should have and its overall thickness . The thickness can not be resolved
seismically as the unit is very thin and beyond the resolution of seismic data .
Consequently the volume of oilinplace for the unit may range from 2.5 x 105m to 3.5
x 10m .

Challis14 Log Interpretation Report

INTRODUCTION

Challis14 was drilled as a development well in the north eastern part of the Chailis
horst . The well was located approximately 395 m southwest of Challis6.and 1030 m
east northeast of Challis3 . The primary target was the C3.2C3.3 sand which was
predicted to be 20 metres thick at Challis14 . The C3.2C3.3 sand was encountered 5
metres lower than prognosed at 1398 m and was 21 metres thick . The C4.0 C5.0
C5.15.2 C6.0 and Pollard sands were also intersected by Challis14 . The oil water
contact is interpreted to be at 1434.5 m and was intersected in the C4.0 sand .

The open hole wireline data was interpreted using Optima a probabilistic
interpretation method which is incorporated in the Atlas Wireline WDS software
System .

All depths used in this report are referenced to the rotary table of the Sedco708
( mRT ) which is 26.5 m above sea level .

2 ... AVAILABLE DATA
2.1 Conventional Cores
Two conventional cores were in Challis14 through the C3.2C3.3 sands as tabulated
below .
Core Depth Recovered Recovery Depth Shift
( m ) Core ( m ) ( 2 ) ( m )
1 1393.6 1398.8 5 96 t14
2 1398.8 1423.5 23.4 95 . t14
.Conventional core analysis was carried out on 96 regular and 81 alternate plugs by
ACS Laboratories Darwin . The core was extremely unconsolidated and had to be
frozen before plugs could be taken . The results of the core analysis are therefore
unlikely to be representative of reservoir characteristics as the freezing will have
significantly altered the state of the core . Measured core porosities and
permeabilities are expected to be higher than original values .
As the quality of the core was in doubt no overburden pressure tests were conducted
on the core .
2.2 Sidewall Cores
No sidewall cores were taken in Challis14
2.3 Logs Run
The Sperry Sun MWD tool was used while drilling Challis14 to collect gamma ray
directional and resistivity data . MWD was run from the 1336 casing shoe at 1051 m
to TD ( 1676 m ) .
Only one suite of open hole wireline logs was run on Challis14 . The logs were run
in 124 hole after drilling to TD .

Wireline Testing

Thirtytwo RFT pretests were taken in Challis14 on 19 and 20 February 1994 . No
samples were attempted . An oil gradient ( 1.01 psim ) was observed down to 1410.5
m. The fluid in the C5.0 CS.15.2 and Pollard sands was shown to be water with
varying degrees of depletion from the original reservoir conditions . The C4.0 sand
showed the greatest amount of depletion which is consistent with the fact that the
C4.0 producer ( Challis6 ) is closer to Challis14 than the other producers . The C4.0
pretest data indicates that the sand is predominantly water bearing but the fluid in
the top two metres of the sand ( 1432.51434.5 m ) can not be conclusively identified
from the RFT information .

Refer to the Challis14 RFT Report for further details .
Production Testing

No production testing was carried out in this well .

3 ... HOLE CONDITIONS

3.1 . Caliper ..
The hole was drilled with a 1244 bit and was severely washed out in the claystones
of the Echuca Shoals Formation overlying the Challis Formation . However the
borehole was in relatively good condition through the C3.2C3.3 sand being
approximately 0.25 overgauge through the top 6 m of the sand and 0.7 overgauge
in the lower 4 m .
A 1.12 SG KCIPHPApolymer mud was used to drill the well .

3.2 Borehole Fluids

The following mud data was recorded by Schlumberger normalised to 257C using

the Arps equation .
Type : KCIPHPA
KC1 : 5.8k by weight
Cr : 38000 ppm
Weight : 1.12 gcm
R 0.111 ohm.m @ 24C ( 0.108 ohm.m @ 257C )

R. 0.094 ohm.m @ 24C ( 0.092 ohm.m @ 25C )
R. s 0.156 ohm.m @ 24C ( 0.153 ohm.m @ 25C )

3.3 Temperature

The following maximum temperatures were recorded during logging :

BHT Depth .. Tool : Time After Circulating Time
( C ) ( m ) Circulation ( hours )
( hours )
61 1666 DLL 6.75 . 1.75
65 1666 LDL 14.17 ... : 15
68 1666 . FMS 18.17 1.75
Extrapolated BHT 70 ? C at 1666 m
Reservoir Temperature . 3 617C at 1406 m

The temperature gradient calculated in the Challis and Cassini Petrophysical Field
Study ( Aldred 1991 ) was 3.467C per 100 m with an extrapolated average surface
temperature of 12.6C . These parameters would result in a calculated BHT of
69.3C for Challis14 which indicates that this well is on the same geothermal
gradient defined by previous wells in the ChallisCassini field .

The gross hydrocarbon column ( 14011434.5 m ) extends over the C3.23.3 sand and
into the top two metres of the C4.0 sand . The oil water contact is masked by a shaly
interval but there is clearly oil down to 1434.5 m and water up to 1439 m. This is
consistent with the original field oil water contact which was at 1410.5 m TVDSS
( 1437 mRT Sedco708 ) .

The saturation cutoff used to define net pay is not satisfied in the sand stringers at the
base of the C3.23.3 ( Enclosure 1 ) . However the PLT run after the well had been
perforated between 1395 and 1421 m showed that the sands below 1410.5 m were
contributing to flow . It is likely that the interpretation underestimates the oil
saturation through this interval because the log responses would have been affected by
the washouts .

The core porosity data is plotted with the interpreted log porosity in Enclosure 2 .
The core porosities are approximately 296 higher than the interpreted log porosities
across the main oil bearing section ( 1402 141 m ) . Higher core porosities were
expected because the core had been frozen ( refer to Section 2.1 ) .

Challis14 RFT Report . l
OPERATIONS SUMMARY

Challis14 was spudded on 6 February 1994 in permit AC1L3 ( Figure 1 ) to develop
the C3.2C3.3 sand of the Challis Formation .

A single RFT run was made on 19 and 20 February over the interval 1402.5 mRT to
1649.0 mRT with a total of 35 pretest attempted ( 28 pretests were successful 1 was
tight 2 were unrecognisable and 4 were seal failures ) . The pretests attempted at
1396.0 mRT and between 1418.0 mRT and 1423.3 mRT were taken coming out of the
hole and were tests for flow only .

Table summarises the basic we ! l data .

CONCLUSIONS

2.1 All the reservoirs tested were depleted relative to the original pressures
measured by the Challisi RFT as summarised below :

2.2 The oil bearing sand stringer at 1396 mRT had little permeability ( measured
mobility was 47 mDcP ) .

2.3 Formation pressures measured in the C4.0 sand are under the influence of the
well drawdown of Challis6 which produces this reservoir . For this reason
they should not be taken as a true indication of the current reservoir pressure .

Chaliis14 RFT Report 2

The almost uniform depletion in the C3.2C3.3 C5.0 C5.1C5.2 sands is
highly suggestive of pressure communication via the aquifer . In that case the
C4.0 sand would also be in communication with the above sand units as the
C4.0 is between the C3.2C3.3 and C5.0 . This is further supported given that
the C4.0 had the same depletion as the C3.2C3.3 at the time Challis12 was
drilled .

The Pollard Formation is either not in communication with the Challis
Formation or any communication is via a tortuous route .

The C3.2C3.3 sand is not in pressure communication with the C3.0 reservoir .

RFT OBJECTIVES

The two main objectives of the Challis14 RFT program were as follows :

a .

To determine the reservoir pressures in all penetrated Challis Formation and
Pollard Formation sands .

To establish the pressure gradient in all sands and identify any wateroil
contacts .

RFT PRETEST INTERPRETATION

4.1

All pretest data are listed in Table 2 . The positions of the pretests are shown
on the iog section ( Figure 2 ) . In all 35 pretests were attempted ( 25 in the
Challis Formation and 10 in the Pollard Formation ) .

The pretests designated 30 30A 31 31A and 32 were all taken while POOH
to establish if the stringer sands in the oil would flow ( ie . had any
permeability ) . Due to hysteresis effects temperatures and pressures recorded
at these points were not included in any of the interpretation . Only one of
these pretests was successful ( 1396.0 mRT ) however it had little permeability
as indicated by a drawdown mobility of 47 mDcP .

Pressures
Valid formation pressures were recorded on 28 pretests ( Figure 3 ) . All the

sands tested were depleted to varying degrees relative to the original pressures
measured by the Challis1 RFT ( See Section 2.1 Figure 4 ) .

Challis14 RFT Report 3

Reservoir Fluid Gradients

No fluid gradients were calculated . It is highly unlikely the gradients derived

from formation pressure data is solely the result fluid pressure . Each sand

intersected by Chailis14 was pressure depleted due to production ( either
directly or via the common aquifer ) from the Chaliis Field .

As a result of reservoir heterogeneities the pressure depletion of each reservoir
is unlikely to be uniform ( differential depletion ) and so any fluid gradients
derived from this data would be a misrepresentation of the true fluid density .
Also there is no reason to believe that aquifer composition has changed

significantly since the start up of production . The water density should be the

same as Was established in Challis1 .

C3.2C3.3 Reservoir

Five successful pretests were taken over the interval 1402.5 mRT to 1410.5

mRT ( the C3.2C3.3 sand ) with the open hole logs showing a clean sand with
a high oil saturation . The C3.2C3.3 sand was depleted by approximately 179
psi indicating that the sand is in communication with other Challis Formation
producing reservoirs via the aquifer . The pressure depletion of the C3.2C3.3
sand indicates it is not in pressure communication with the C3.0 reservoir as
this sand is pressure supported via water injection and is currently above
original Challis Field reservoir pressure .

Comparing the results of Challis14 with the formation pressures measured by
Challis12 in the C3.2C3.3 sand ( Figure 5 ) only minor pressure depletion
( about 7 psi ) has occurred since Challis12 was drilled in July 1992 .

C4.0 Reservoir

Twelve Pretests were attempted over the interval 1433.5 mRT to 1457.0 mRT
( C4.0 sand ) resulting in ten good tests and two which gave an unrecognisable
response ( three attempts were made to get a good test between 1435.3 mRT
and 1435.7 mRT ) . The pressure measurements taken in the C4.0 sand implied
the C4.0 aquifer was depleted by 320 to 382 psi over the interval tested . If
these were true reservoir pressures it implies a further 200 psi ( approximately )
depletion since the Challis12 RFT was taken in July 1992 ( Figure 5 ) . At the
time of Challis12 the C4.0 reservoir pressure was in line with that measured
in the C3.2C3.3 sand . Since then the pressures measured by the Challis14
RFT imply the C4.0 sand has been depleted by a further 200 psi yet only 3655
of the total fluids produced to date have been withdrawn between the drilling of
Challis12 and 14 . Given this conflicting data it is almost certain that the
pressure measurements taken over this interval were under the influence of the
drawdown from Challis6 which produces the C4.0 reservoir and is only 400
m to the NE of Challis14 .

Challis14 RFT Report 4

Given the almost uniform depletion of the C3.2C33 C5.0 and C5.1C5.2
sands it is not unreasonable for the unaffected aquifer pressure to be depleted
by a similar amount . Assuming an average depietion of 170 psi the unaffected
aquifer pressure of the C4.0 in the middle of the sand ( 1445 mRT ) would be
approximately 1920 psia .

C5.0 Reservoir

Two successful pretests were taken at 1488.0 mRT and 1496.0 mRT ( C5.0
sand ) . Both measurements in the sand indicated a reasonably uniform depletion
of 152 psi from the original Challis1 pressure gradient and from the relative
amount of depletion this sand is in communication with other Challis
Formation reservoirs via the aquifer .

C5.1C5.2 Reservoir

Two successful pretests were taken at 1509.0 mRT and 1516.0 mRT
( C5.1C5.2 sand ) . Both measurements in the sand indicated a reasonably
uniform depletion of 146 psi from the original Challis1 pressure gradient and
from the relative amount of depletion this sand is in communication with other
Challis Formation reservoirs via the aquifer .

Pollard Formation

Fight successful pretests were taken over the.interval 1574.0 mRT to 1649.0
mRT ( Pollard Formation ) . The formation pressures measured in the Pollard
indicated a reasonably uniform pressure depletion of 22 psi from the original
Challis1 pressure gradient . Given the small amount of depietion in this
formation compared to the depletion in the aquifer of the Challis Formation

either this sand is not in pressure communication with the sands of the Challis

Formation or if they are in communication the pathway must be tortuous .

Fluid contacts

No fluid contacts were observed .

OPERATIONS SUMMARY

Challis14 was spudded on 6 February 1994 in permit ACIL3 ( Figure 1 ) to develop
the C3.2C3.3 sand of the Challis Formation . The well reached a total depth of 1676
mRT ( 1654 mSS ) on 18 February 1994 . Completion activities commenced on 21
February 1994 following open hole logs which confirmed the presence of oil bearing
sands .

Flowback operations commenced at 1830 hours on 27 February 1994 following well
perforation ( perforated interval 1395 mRT and 1421 mRT ) . A clean up flow back was
followed by : PLT surveys with the well shut in and flowing ( Figure 2 ) . The flow back
during the PLT surveys was at a restricted rate as oil production could not be flared
due to safety concerns ( as a result of an earlier air compressor fire ) . Completion
activities ended on 1 March 1994

Challis14 was reentered for further PLT surveys on 2 March 1994 to confirm flow
contribution from the main sand interval ( 1402 mRT to 1411 mRT ) . A total of six
logging runs and five well flow periods were completed ( Figure 3 ) . Although
obtaining a spinner survey across the perforated interval was the main objective of re
entering the well no surveys were obtained despite five attempts .

The total volume of oil recovered from all flow periods was 381 sm ?

Table 1 summarises the basic well data .

CONCLUSIONS
2.1 . A final productivity index of 70 stbdpsi was measured .

2.2 Temperature logs indicated clean up of the main C3.2C3.3 sand with
significant flow contribution from the interval 1403 mRT to 1409 mRT .

2.3 Temperature logs indicated a small flow contribution from the stringer sand at
1415 mRT to 1417 mRT .

2.4 During the flowing gradient survey conducted during the well reentry gas
break out occurred somewhere in the range 1160 psia to 1450 psia . A most

.likely bubble point pressure of 1160 psia at 64.9 C was estimated from
statistical analysis of the data .

25 The temperature anomaly identified in the initial flowback could be interpreted
as due to flow behind casing prior to perforation .

PRODUCTION LOGGING OBJECTIVES

The three objectives of the Challis14 initial flowback production logging program
were a3 follows :

a .

To obtain a stabilised flow rate and a bottom hoie flowing pressure to enable
the calculation of the well productivity index .

To obtain a qualitative indication of the flow contribution over the perforated
intervals using temperature .

To obtain a flowing pressure gradient and gradiomanometer readings to enable
vertical flow performance modeiling and to identify at what depth gas break out
OCCUIS .

The two objectives of the Challis14 well reentry production logging program were as

follows :

a .

To confirm the flow contributions over the perforated intervals using a fullbore
spinner .

b . To obtain a stabilised flow rate and a bottom hole flowing pressure to enable
the calculation of the well productivity index .

DISCUSSION

4.1 Initial Flowback

4.1.1 Flow Period 1 ( Clean Up )

Following perforation at 1830 hours on 27 February 1994 Challis14
was flowed to clean up the well . The well was beaned up to a
maximum liquid rate of 665 sm ? d on a choke setting of 19 mm . The
well was shut in at 2115 hours with 17 sm of oil recovered at surface
( Figure 4 ) .

4.1.2 PLT Run l

Three PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were conducted over the perforated
interval ( 1395 mRT to i421 mRT ) . Challis14 was opened at 0214
hours on 28 February 1994 with the oil rate restricted to approximately
120 sm ? d for the majority of the flow period as it was decided not to
flare due to safety concerns ( the concerns arose after a small fire on one
of the air compressors ) . Production was shut in at 0400 hours
following the completion of the PLT surveys ( Figure 5 ) . A total of 7
sm ? of oil was recovered at surface during the flow period .

Challis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 3

Two pressure measurements of 1847.4 psia and 1835.2 psia were
obtained at 1395 mRT with the well shut in and flowing at 130 sm3d
respectively ( See Section 4.3 for productivity index calculations ) .

Only temperature and strain gauge pressure could be surveyed as the
gradiomanometer and HP gauge failed during pressure testing and while
RIH respectively .

The temperature logs indicated flow from the intervals 1402 mRT to
1405 mRT and 1407 mRT to i409 mRT . These are indicated by the
inflections in the temperature gradient .

The majority of the flow must have been eminating from the upper
interval because the temperature gradient is flatter above the interval
than below it ( indicating there is a greater specific heat ie greater
flow above the interval than below ) .

This was confirmed by the static temperature profile taken 2 days later
( Figure 10 ) showing the well had cooled off more above the interval
than below it and by the flowing gradient survey ( Figure 8 ) . The
survey showed an oil gradient above 1405 mRT and completion brine
below which would indicate that any flow below 1405 mRT was
insufficient to lift the completion brine .

The temperature logs also showed an slightly hotter anomaly in the
welibore between approximately 1408 mRT and 1419 mRT ( Figure 6 ) .
The maximum deviation from the underlying wellbore temperature
gradient was 2 C at 1413 mRT . Over this interval the main sand
( 1402 mRT to 1411 mRT ) of the C3.2C3.3 reservoir is separated from
the lower sand stringers by a shalier section ( 1411 mRT and 1415
mRT ) . One explanation for the anomaly could be cross flow behind
casing ( prior to well perforation ) heating this shale above the
geothermal gradient as illustrated in the schematic in Figure 7 . This
interpretation is based on two assumptions :

i ) The sand stingers below the main sand were isolated and at the
original reservoir pressure ( these sand stringers were not tested
during the RFT survey ) .

ii ) The cement bond between the main sand and the lower sand
stringers was poor . The CBL showed a poor cement bond
however the CET suggested this was due to a micro annulus .

From the RFT survey the main sand was shown to be depleted by 180
psi from the original reservoir pressure . If the sand stringers were at
original reservoir pressure and the cement bond poor flow from the
sand stringers to the main sand would have occurred for up to seven
days before the well was perforated .

Challis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 4

This interpretation is further supported by the flowing gradient survey
conducted over the perforations ( Figure 8 ) . The derived fluid density
below 1405 mRT was comparable to the completion brine ( 1.13 SG @
207C ) . This suggests very little or no flow below this point ( if the
perforations were flowing it was insufficient to lift the brine ) and poor
clean up of the main C3.2C3.3 sand . With flow coming from well
above the region of the anomaly there would be very little heat
dissipated in the few hours between perforation and logging the well .

The temperature anomaly disappeared after a second clean up flow
when the well was reentered two days later ( see Section 4.2.6 )

A flowing gradient survey was performed while POOH ( Figure 9 ) . The
change in gradient indicating gas break out was very subtle . A most
likely bubble point pressure of 1120 psia at 48.6 C was estimated based
on statistical analysis of the data .

42 Well ReEntry

4.2.1

4.2.2

Tool Performance

A spinner survey across the perforations was the main objective of the
well reentry . Five unsuccessful attempts were made . During each the
PLT run the spinner response was lost before reaching the perforations .
Two spinners types were used ( a fullbore for the first four PLT runs Ai
and an inline on the final run ) however this made no difference . On
each occasion only temperature and strain gauge pressure were
surveyed . The gradiomanometer and HP gauge could not be repaired
and were not replaced after the initial flowback operations .

The problems with obtaining a spinner response were initialiy thought to
be hole related . Following the first two PLT runs material fibres were
found on the tool string at surface ( the material fibres were wrapped
around the fullbore spinner blades following the first run ) . However
there was no obvious cause for the loss of spinner response following
the latter three runs as the spinner functioned normaliy when returned to
surface . The PLT surveys conducted on the next well ( Skua3 )
suggested the problem may have resuited from the defective .
gradiomanometer . The response from the spinner is amplified through
this tool . Logging runs on Skua3 with a CPLT tool resulted in
successful spinner surveys

CCL Survey

A CCL survey on high gain was conducted in an attempt to confirm the
perforated interval . No perforations were identified by the survey .

PLT Run 1

This run was the first # ttempi at spinner calibration and to check for
cross flow with the well shut in . Two PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were
conducted over the perforated interval ( 1395 mRT to 1421 mRT ) . A

with the well shut in .

: The temperature logs still showed a hotter anomaly in the wellbore

between approximately 1408 mRT and 1419 mRT however the
maximum deviation from the underlying wellbore temperature gradient
had reduced from the 2 C recorded two days earlier to approximately
0.4 C at 1416 mRT ( Figure 10 ) .

PLT Run 2

No surveys were conducted during this run . This was the second
attempt at spinner calibration and to check for cross flow with the well
shut in . The tool was POOH when the spinner response was lost .

Flow Period 1 ( Clean Up )

Following the initial flowback and the first PLT run of the well re
entry it was evident that Challis14 had not completely cleaned up .
The well was opened at 2132 hours on 2 March 1994 and beaned up to
a maximum liquid rate of 1168 sm3d on a choke setting of 25 mm .
The well was shut in at 2320 hours with 60 sm ? of oil recovered at
surface ( Figure 11 ) .

PLT Run 3

Twelve PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were conducted over the perforated
interval ( 1395 mRT to 1421 mRT ) . Challis14 was opened at 0128
hours on 3 March 1994 and beaned up to a maximum oil production
rate of 1114 sm ? d . Production was shut in at 0652 hours following the
completion of the PLT surveys ( Figure 12 ) . A total of 213 sm of oil
was recovered at surface during the flow period .

The flowing bottom hole pressure was monitored between surveys . A
final static pressure measurements of 1762.1 psia was obtained at 1395
mRT with the well flowing at 1052 sm3d .

The temperature logs indicated the main C3.2C3.3 sand had cleaned
upwith the major contribution to flow coming from between 1403 mRT
and 1409 mRT . The temperature logs also indicated a smaller
contribution to flow from the sand stringer between 1415 mRT and
1417 mRT ( Figure 13 ) . The temperature anomaly observed in previous
surveys had disappeared following the earlier clean up flow period
( Figure 14 ) .

Challis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 6

Clean up of the main sand and the small contribution to flow from the
C3.2C3.3 stringer sands were further confirmed by a flowing gradient

survey conducted over the perforations ( Figure 15 ) . The derived fluid

density over the main sand indicated coil . Below 1412 mRT the derived 8 .
fluid density was comparable to the completion brine ( 1.13 SG @ 20 C )
which suggests very little or no flow below this point ( if the

perforations were flowing it was insufficient to lift the brine ) .

A flowing gradient survey was performed while POOH ( Figure 16 ) .
The change in gradient indicating gas break out was very subtie
occurting anywhere between 1160 psia to 1450 psia . A most likely
bubble point pressure of 1160 psia at 64.9 C was estimated based on
statistical analysis of the data .

42.7 PLT Run4

Four PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were conducted over the perforated interval
( 1395 mRT to 1421 mRT ) . Chaliis14 was opened at 0856 hours on 3
March 1994 and beaned up to a maximum oil production rate of 385
sm3d ( Figure 17 ) . Production was shut in briefly at 1000 hours with
the weli reopened at 1014 hours to a maximum flow of 1088 sm3d .
Production was shut in at 1137 bours following the completion of the
PLT surveys ( Figure 18 ) . Respective totals of 9 sm ? and 39 sm ? of oii
were recovered at surface during each flow periods .

The temperature logs indicated similar results to PLT run 3 ( Figure 19 ) . ..
4.2.8 PLT Run5

This run was aborted before any data was obtained . Challis14 was
opened at 1313 hours on 3 March 1994 and beaned up to a maximum
oil production rate of 1190 sm ? d . Production was shut in at 1412
hours when the production logging program was aborted ( Figure 20 ) .
A total of 36 sm ? of oil was recovered at surface .

Productivity Index

Productivity indices ( P1 ) were measured during the initial flowback and well re
entry of 40 stbdpsi and 70 stbdpsi respectively . The increase in PI between
the two measurements can be attributed to the clean up of the well . The PIs

Study Of Challis14 Conventional Core Material

1 INTRODUCTION

This report is based on a detailed examination and descriptioninterpretation of 28.60 m
of slabbed conventional core ( cores 42 ) cut in Challis14 . This work was
undertaken by P.A . Arditto on November 14 1994 at the Kestral Wharehouse in
Mount Waverly at the request of Mr. Ian Garven ( Reservoir Characterisation Manager )
of BHP Petroleum .

This final report contains the detailed lithological description and environmental
interpretation of the recovered cored interval followed by graphic core description
sheets at 1:25 scale core gamma ray log data and wireline log data over and adjacent
to the cored interval . A key to sedimentary structures and lithology symbois used on
the core description sheets is given at the end of the report .

22 Environmental Interpretation

The interval 1393.60 m to 1393.92 m is interpreted as the basal remnants of two lower
point bar channel cycles . The high core and wire line log gamma ray response in an
apparently well sorted sandstone facies indicates the presence of hot detrital minerals
within this interval . The interval 1393.92 m to 1395.40 m is interpreted as a stacked
succession of crevasse splay cycles deposited in a lower coastal plain setting . The
abundance of shaly flaser drapes contributes to the high gamma ray response over this
interval . The interval 1395.40 m to 1397.25 m is interpreted as overbank or abandoned
channel fili deposited ih a lower coastal plain setting . The intensity of bioturbation
indicates brackish water or even more open marine influence perhaps in a delta fringe
setting . The presence of rootlet structures in the upper third of the interval may
indicate a colonised levee bank palaeosol . The interval 1397.25 m to 1400.00 m is
interpreted as a possible distal crevasse splay interval deposited during the early stage
of a channel abandonment cycle within a high sinuosity lower coastal plain fluvial
system . The presence of minor small burrows indicates at least a brackish water
influence during sedimentation .

The interval 1400.00 m to 1400.35 m is interpreted as an upward fining point bar
channel cycle which gives way to channel abandonment in the overlying interval . The
interval 14.35 m to 1409.40 m is an aggradational succession of individual lower to
middle point bar channel units separated by scour surfaces . Trough cross bedding
characterises deposition within the lower point bar channel while current ripple or
flaser laminations characterise the waning energy of the middle point bar . The absence
of the upper point bar abandonment cycle indicates deposition during late flood to
early falling stage within a low sinuosity fluvial system . No burrows or other marine
or brackish water indicators are evident and the interval is interpreted as a significant
fluvial discharge into a more generally marine influenced lower coastal plain setting .

The interval 1409.40 m to 1409.83 m is interpreted as a middle point bar tidal channel
unit as evidenced by the basal scour and the presence of flasers and bioturbation . The
interval 1409.83 m to 1412.13 m is interpreted as a stacked succession of distal
crevasse splay units deposited in a marine influenced lower coastal plain lagoonal

Study Of Challis14 Conventional Core Material 5

setting ( as evidenced by the intensity of bioturbation and burrowing abundance of
carbonaceous material and soft sediment deformation ) . The interval 1412.13 m to
1413.95 m is interpreted as stacked tidal channel units ( scoured base common burrows
and flasers ) which grades into the overlying channel abandonment crevasse splay
succession . Dewatering and loadflame features indicate rapid and episodic deposition

of these units .

The interval 1413.95 m to 1414.85 m is interpreted as a channel abandonment
succession deposited during a low stage fluvial cycle within a lower coastal plain
setting . The base of the interval contain a possible rootlet horizon which penetrate
into the underlying interval indicating plant colonisation . The interval 1414.85 m to
1415.30 m is interpreted a a stream mouth bar channel unit . The interval 1415.30 m to
1416.83 m is interpreted as a deltaic prograde unit building into a marginal marine
setting ( as evidenced by the upward coarsening nature and common burrows ) . The
interval 1416.83 m to 1419.10 m is interpreted as two proximal point bar tidal channel
units as evidenced by the scour surfaces upward fining character and common
burrows . The lower unit displays evidence of slump movement and has a highly
incised basal scour surface . The upper unit displays a better developed abandonment
cycle and is gradational into the overlying unit . Abandonment appears to be caused by
a marine incursion which initiated the overlying deltaic prograde .

The interval 1419.10 m to 1421.50 m is interpreted to be a stacked succession of distal
estuarine bay channel units as evidenced by the upward fining and muddy burrowed to
bioturbated character of individual units . The interval 1421.50 m to 1421.97 m is
interpreted as an abandoned channel fill unit deposited in a marine influenced setting
as evidenced by the extent of flasers and bioturbation . The interval 1421.97 m to
1422.20 m ( base of core 2 ) is interpreted as the uppermost part of a middle point bar
channel unit ( base of unit not intersected by the core ) .
