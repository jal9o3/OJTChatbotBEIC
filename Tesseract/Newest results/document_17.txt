Wisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )

1 INTRODUCTION

The Wisteria1 vertical exploration well was drilled by the jackup rig West Atlas in
Permit ACP32 in the Timor Sea . The well is located some 690 km west of Darwin and
approximately 20 km east of the Skua Oil Field and 25 km north east of the Montara
Oil Field ( Figure 1 ) .

The rotary table elevation of the West Atlas was 38.1 metres . Unless stated
otherwise depth measurements in this report are Drillers depths with respect to the
rotary table and are referenced as mMDRT . Sea level reference is Australian Height
Datum ( AHD ) .

Wisteria1 was spudded at 13:00 Hrs on 22 August 2008 . Water depth at the
location was 96.5 metres AHD . A 914 mm surface hole was drilled to 174.0 mMDRT
and a 762 mm x 508 mm ( 30 x 20 ) tapered conductor was set at 168.5 mMDRT .

445mm ( 17 72 ) hole was drilled with returns to the sea to 1670.0 mMDRT . 340mm
( 13 38 ) casing was run and cemented at 1645.7 mMDRT and the BOP installed and
tested .

311mm ( 12 4 ) hole was drilled ( 9 bit runs ) to a TD of 3281.0 mMDRT ( 15 September
2008 ) . FEWD logs ( Gamma RayResistivityDensityPorosity ) were run to 2805.0
mMDRT . Below this depth only Gamma Ray and Resistivity tools were run due to a
failure of the DensityPorosity tool .

At TD 2 wireline logging runs were conducted as follows :

Run 1 : Checkshot survey
Run 2 : GRTLDCNLDSI

The well was then plugged and abandoned and the rig went off contract when on tow 1

km from the Wisteria1 location at 08:00 hours on the 22 September 2008 after 32.5
days on location .

2 . OPERATIONS SUMMARY

The rig came on hire to Coogee Resources ( Ashmore Cartier ) Pty Ltd for Wisteria1
when 1 km from the Swallow1 location which occurred at 20:00 Hrs ( CST ) on 20
August 2008 . The rig was towed to the Wisteria1 location and was positioned and
pinned at 05:30 hours on 21 ? August 2008 . The rig was pre loaded without incident
before jacking up to operating height in preparation for drilling . The final well position
was 4.79 m on a bearing of 23.4 ( True ) from the intended location and the rig heading
was 224.6 ( True ) . The water depth at the location was 96.5m and the rig elevation
was 36.1m .

The 914 mm ( 36 ) spud assembly was run and the well spudded at 13:00 hours on the
22 August 2008 . The 914660 mm ( 3626 ) hole section was drilled to 172.0
mMDRT and the 762 x 508 mm ( 30 x 20 ) tapered conductor run and set with the
shoe at 168.1 mMDRT ( Figure 2 ) .

# # Note : the conductor hung up 1.5m above landing depth and as a result the rig was
jacked up 2.0 m to allow for the conductor space out ( new RT elevation 38.1mm ) .

The top of the 762 mm ( 30 ) conductor was set just above the sea bed and a 508 mm
( 20 ) riser was run back to the rig . The riser had ports located just below sea level
which were designed to allow returns to dissipate away from the well at the seabed
and also provide an auto fill ! mechanism should loss of returns be encountered in the
445 mm ( 17 72 ) hole section .

A 445mm ( 17 72 ) hole was drilled vertically to a section TD of 1670.0 mMDRT and the
drilling assembly was pulled out of the hole and the 340mm ( 13 38 ) casing was run
and cemented with the shoe set at 1645.7 mMDRT .

The 340mm ( 13 38 ) casing was drilled out with a dumb drilling assembly ( MWD tools
late arriving on the rig ) to 1739.0 mMDRT and a Formation Integrity Test conducted
before pulling out to pick up the MWD tools . The 311 mm ( 12 4 ) hole section was
then drilled with a motor ( 0.78 ? bend ) and FEWD tools for the acquisition of gamma
ray resistivity porosity and density data . The logging tools were wiped over the
previously drilled hole section ( 1670.0 to 1739.0 mMDRT ) and drilling then continued
from 1739.0 mMDRT . A small correction in the well path direction was made in order
to remain within the target tolerance and drilling continued to 2507.0 mMDRT where a
5 stand wiper trip was conducted ( due to slow penetration rates thought to be from bit
balling ) . Drilling resumed with improved ROP and continued to 2803.0 mMDRT where
another wiper trip was carried out due to slowing ROP . On resuming drilling the ROP
remained slow ( 2 mhr ) and the decision was made to trip for a new bit at 2805.0
mMDRT . When loading the source for the density tool at surface prior to running into
the hole a problem occurred which required the tool to be laid out . With no back up
available the assembly was run into the hole with only Gamma Ray and Resistivity
tools included . Drilling then continued to 2862.0 mMDRT where the penetration rate
slowed significantly and at 2872.0 mMDRT ( after 10m of very slow drilling ) a trip was
made to change the bit once again . The BHA was changed for this bit run with the
motor being taken out in order to allow better rotary control of the bit . Drilling
continued to 2877.0 mMDRT however the ROP remained very slow and a further trip
was made to change the bit . An insert rock bit was picked up and run into the hole to
drill the hard cemented sandstone and at 2916.0 mMDRT a bit trip was made to pick
up another PDC bit as the cuttings indicated the bit was back into siltstone ( real time
GRRes FEWD failed at 2905.0 mMDRT ) . A PDC bit was run into the hole ( FEWD
GRRes failed shallow test ) but after only about 2.0m more cemented sandstone was
encountered and after slowly drilling to 2937.0 mMDRT another bit trip was made .
The PDC bit was severely rung out and so another insert rock bit was picked up . The

Wisteria1 WCR Basic Data

-----Page 9-----

Wisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )

rock bit drilled into siltstone ( no real time FEWD data ) and the ROP improved to 6 to 8
mhr . Between 3088.0 and 3092.0 mMDRT another hard sand was encountered and
then after drilling through this at around 2 mhr another trip was made at 3104.0
mMDRT to pick up a PDC bit . The PDC bit was run into the hole ( GRRes FEWD tools
replaced and successfully shallow tested ) and drilled to 3176.0 mMDRT where a
nutplug pill was pumped to try and improve the ROP . Real time MWD data was lost
after pumping the pill however drilling continued slowly to 3194.0 mMDRT where a trip
was made to change the bit . A rock bit was picked up and after unsuccessful attempts
to clean out the MWD pulser the back up Powerpulse tool was picked up in order to
have real time Gamma Ray data . Drilling then continued to a TD of 3281.0 mMDRT
which was reached at 21:30 hours on 15 September 2008 . After circulating the hole
clean the drilling assembly was pulled out of the hole and the FEWD tools laid out .

At TD 2 wireline logging runs were conducted as follows :

Suite 1 :
Run 1 : Checkshot survey
Run 2 : GRTLDCNLDSI

On completion of wireline logging the well was plugged and abandoned . The casing
was cut at 156.0 mMDRT and a seabed survey conducted prior to the rig moving off
location . The rig went off contract at 08:00 hours on the 22 ? September 2008 after
32.5 days on location .

FORMATION SAMPLING

Ditch Cuttings

No samples were collected above 1670.0 mMDRT as this section of the hole was
drilled riserless with cuttings returned to the seabed . Cuttings samples were collected
at 5 and 10 metre intervals ( ROP dependant ) from 1670.0 to 3281.0 mMDRT . The
sample breakdown of the cuttings from the 311mm ( 12 14 ) hole is given in Table 2
with a complete sample listing included in the BHI EOWR ( Appendix 6 ) . The samples
for Coogee Resources are stored with Wilson Archives in Perth .
