CO : emissions the elephant in the room : a pathway of reduction using digitalization and
unstructured data

Introduction

In this paper we are exploring the challenges associated to climate change in the energy industry with
the paradigm of extracting oil and gas in a low CO environment to limit the effect of climate change
and provide the world with affordable source of energy for mobility and heat generation .

We will be discussing how carbon accounting allows to track direct and indirect source of emissions
its origins and the challenges associated to them .

Finally we will investigate how modern technology such as data mining can help mitigate direct and
indirect emissions by increasing operations efficiency identifying operation flaws and implementing
scalable Carbon Capture and Storage ( CCS ) implementation .

CO ? emission and world energy consumption

Recently the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) issued the sixth Assessment Report
( AR6 ) related to Climate Change 2022 : Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability which highlights
the urgency of limiting the increase of temperature to 1.5 ? C to reduce the impact of climate change :
Global warming reaching 1.5 ? C in the nearterm would cause unavoidable increases in multiple
climate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans ( very high confidence ) . ... Near
term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5 ? C would substantially reduce projected losses
and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems compared to higher warming
levels but can not eliminate them all ( very high confidence ) . ( IPCC 2022 ) .

In addition the AR6 report linked to Climate Change 2022 : Mitigation of Climate Change suggests
that All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5C ... involve rapid and deep and in
most cases immediate GHG emission reductions in all sectors . Modelled mitigation strategies to
achieve these reductions include transitioning from fossil fuels without CCS to very low or zerocarbon

energy sources such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS demand side measures and improving
efficiency reducing nonCO emissions ( IPCC 2022 ) .

While limiting the reduction of CO : to reduce the impact of climate change the world is still highly
dependent on fossil fuels with fossil energies accounting in 2019 for more than 80X44 in total and OilGas
for 6070 alone ( Figure 1 ) . Combined with the need of powering the world and the challenges of climate
change the energy sector has a central play to significantly monitor and reduce its CO ? footprint .

Carbon accounting

Carbon accounting is the process which allows organization to quantify and monitor Greenhouse Gas
( GHG ) emissions . By construction carbon accounting counts the direct and indirect emissions linked
to the activity of the organization through the full value chain .

Direct emission are the emissions directly related to the own activity of the company such as oilgas
extraction and production and are often referred to scope 1 emissions . Indirect emission are the
emissions emitted considering the full value chain . In the case of the energy industry this would
consider all the necessary services contracted to perform the extraction of oil and gas from the
subsurface and all the emissions related to the usage of the oil and gas as a molecule for the human
usage in mobility industry usage and heat generation . These emissions are falling into the scope 2
associated to the supply of energy ( input ) and the scope 3 linked to the oil and gas products sold ( output ) .

Figure 2 illustrates the breakdowns and evolution of four ( 4 ) representative Oil major operators
emissions until 2018 . In average 1076 of the emissions are associated to direct emission and 9075 of
them are linked to indirect emissions connected to hydrocarbon products sold . Considering oil and gas
commitment in reducing carbon emission this means that both direct and indirect emissions would need
to be tackled simultaneously .

Decades of oil and gas operations associated to the exploration development and production of oil
fields have generated vast amount of data which provides a deep insight of constant optimization of
costs and resources . The data are interpreted and compiled into unstructured data such as reports
presentations and studies providing a carbon copy of the history of the operations . The unstructured
data provides an immense potential of CO emissions reduction for both direct and indirect emissions .
New technology such as Data Mining and Machine Learning technology helps to process and retrieve
information at scale contained in the unstructured data in a pipeline called ingestion of unstructured
data ( Hernandez 2019 ) . The process involves automated pipeline of text identification image
classification Name Entity Recognition ( NER ) Knowledge Graph and Heat Map analysis .

For the direct emissions the ingestion of unstructured data gives the GKG experts a discovery
experience allowing him to interrogate the full corpus of data instantly . Such ingestion platform reduces
the time of information retrieval and provides a holistic view of the lateral extent for the parameters of
interest . An example of such application is seen in Figure 3 where reservoir intervals with high CO :
content is highlighted for more than 500 wells associated to the ingestion of over 45000 unstructured
documents .

Reducing the time of information retrieval provides a unique opportunity of fasttracking studies hence
reduce the CO ? emissions . An extended scope of the data ingestion workflow is the identifying and
tracking the origin of operations flaws and best practices for potential improvement and reduction of
CO emissions ( Hernandez 2021 ) .

The reduction of indirect emissions involves large scale adoption and deployment of CCS capabilities
worldwide . Such a pathway is possible by leveraging on current existing oil and gas assets which are
the mature depleting fields . Extensive work and studies over decades generated a vast amount of data
subsurface studies and production that are mined to rank the best opportunities for CCS based on the
field maturation intervention history and geological settings . Once the target reservoir identified CO
injection can then be monitored wit novel environmentally friendly methods such as using
nondisruptive 4D seismic ( Figure 4 ) to prove the potential . Such Data to Sink funnel provides the
technical scalability and the cost effectiveness to assess CCS potential in a large area of interest .

have demonstrated how digitalization applied on unstructured data can help reduce both direct and
indirect emissions .
