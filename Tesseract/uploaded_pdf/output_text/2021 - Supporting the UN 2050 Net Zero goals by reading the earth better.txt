Supporting the UN 2050 Net Zero goals by reading

the earth better

Nina Marie Hernandez", Kim Gunn Maver and Charmyne Mamador present the ED2K
initiative, providing multivariate earth data to support UN climate change goals.

Introduction

Against the backdrop of the current global pandemic, the UN
2050 net zero goals call for global greenhouse emissions to be cut
by half by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050 to achieve
the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius above pre-in-
dustrial levels. The EU has pledged to become the first carbon.
neutral continent by 2050, and more than 110 other countries
have pledged carbon neutrality by this time. Several energy com-
panies have laid out their medium-to-long-term plans towards
this objective, which includes acquisition of renewables assets,
and developing competitive technologies for carbon capture and
storage (CCS) and hydrogen production. Among the companies
that have set zero-emissions targets are BP, Shell, Total, Repsol,
Equinor and Petronas. This energy pivot will require significant
capital spending to reach the goals.

To determine the technical and economic feasibility of these
new energy technologies and at the same time achieve sustainable
development goals, multivariate earth data, both existing and
new, are required and are key to making the right management
and investment decisions.

EarthDoc pointing to the future

To this end, more than 39 years of conference proceedings and
publications are already available from EAGE through Earth-
Doc, which aggregates a wealth of subsurface information from
research institutions, energy companies, service companies
and dedicated professionals. The 70,000 scientific publications
focus on conventional topics within geoscience and engineering
especially in relation to oil and gas extraction. This subsurface
information can be upcycled to provide highly valuable insights
for new energy technologies. The reuse of existing oil and
gas data reduces data acquisition costs, which translate into a
reduction in research and development costs.

Through a collaboration between Iraya Energies and EAGE, a
new database initiative has been launched with EarthDoc’s repos-
itory of 70,000 scientific publications being processed using the
latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques
and initially available to institutional and corporate subscribers.
The whole data corpus is made instantly accessible and provides
new tools to search and retrieve the diversity of information that
one is looking for across any technical discipline.

With Big Data analytics applied to the entire data corpus of
70,000 scientific publications, additional in-depth and advanced
navigation options are now available.

To extract information on a large scale, the ElasticDocs AI
pipeline is applied to the EarthDoc corpus. This pipeline consists
of a set of algorithms which are used to identify blocks/segments
within the document corpus. Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) is applied to the text segments to convert them into
processable text. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
algorithm pipeline classifies the images into various generic and
geological image classes, including tables, seismic, map, well
plots, stratigraphic charts, core, thin sections, image logs, and
rose diagrams. Untagged images are generically categorized as
figures and remain accessible to the user.

The ingested documents are now available as structured
information for analysis, which is possible in different ways:

+ Metadata extraction of relevant information such as locations,

names etc.

Efficient inter and intra-search of the global text corpus for

quantitative textual analysis of document contents to create

automated and standardized geoscience or engineering content

summary.

Automated heatmaps to visualize density of information

within a basin or country.

+ Image extraction of similar image classes for efficient identifi-
cation of analogues, duplicates and clusters.

.

.

Some key functionality that has a significant impact on utilizing
the scientific publications is that not only are images classified
according to type, but it is possible to do a search on image
embedded text making the search capabilities far more advanced
than just a normal search-and-find option. The search results of
this database are exportable as .csv files making statistical work
and analysis instantly possible across data points.

Proprietary corporate data meets published
scientific knowledge.

Recognizing that energy companies hold valuable information in
their repositories accumulated throughout many decades of oper-
ations, the data kept internally can now be easily integrated with
published geoscience and engineering data. The combination of

database results in a two-way enrichment process between public
and private information. Scientific studies from peers in related
fields offer additional information that either validates internal
company studies, or offer alternative technical perspectives from
industry experts.

@ Pugtications Figure 3 Visualization of knowledge graph illustrates

related geological and engineering concepts.

Several Earth readability tools are deployed in ED2K to
amplify EarthDoc capabilities. This includes access to digital
textual content, the ability to quality control OCR results and
read in multiple languages via machine-translate. Word clouds are
simple context clues which provide a quick summary of content
of the articles.

The full ED2K corpus is geotagged to more than 800
geological basins around the world. The geotagging is one of the
most complex machine learning tasks in this implementation,
because the scientific articles contain both location of the


geological area of interest, as well as the location of confer-
ences where the publications are presented. Often, these two
reference locations are different and introduce ambiguity for the
system.

Another feature that is implemented is the knowledge graph
visualization. It illustrates the connectivity of ‘related concepts’
based on publication references. In the example above, it shows
‘operational excellence’, ‘optimization’ and ‘engineering suc-
cess’ within the same network (Figure 3). Similarly, ‘hydraulic
fracture stimulation’, ‘natural fracture interaction’, and ‘Jurassic
carbonates’ show connectivity. In theory, a knowledge graph can
be built in multiple ways by the user.

Utilizing ED2K to reach the zero-emission goal

The advanced access in the new database makes possible a new
use of the highly valuable subsurface information and facilitates
cross-discipline usage.

Many of the new cross-function usages of the existing
scientific publication repository are geothermal energy, hydrogen.
energy, CCS and windmill foundation derisking.

A query for ‘carbon capture and storage’ generates an
information heat map captured in Figure 4. The map shows the
geographical distribution of the resulting publications either
based on country or basin.

Figure 5 maps out the major carbon capture projects around
the world vis-a-vis needs requirement. Europe and US show high
activity in CCS initiatives, which are driven by government poli-
cy. Comparing Figure 4 and Figure 5 (left), it may be incidental,
although not entirely surprising that where there is a significant
amount of data to aid technical and management decision mak-
ing, CCS implementations are also active.

The new database contains climate change and greenhouse
gases industry discussion materials spanning over three decades.
Already between 1990 and 2000, the possibility of disposing
carbon dioxide (CO,) is discussed in papers such as J. Leeb. W,
(1993), and Wildenborg, F.B., et. al., (1996), in conjunction with
the use of CO, for improved oil recovery methods (IOR).

Between 2001 and 2010, the discussions tackled issues in
establishing a geological storage hub (Espie, 2000) and various
potential site feasibility studies (Gregersen et. al, 2000), costs
(Wildenborg et. al, 2000), use of seismic monitoring (Benson,
2003), (Gosselet et. al., 2006), pilot and numerical simulations
(Domitrovie et. al., 2005), (Battistelli et.al, 2005), reservoir
performance (Broad et.al, 2007) and improving facilities perfor-
mance to reduce operating costs in CO, and H,S contaminated
fields (Swatton et. al, 2009).

From 2011 up to the present, with the advancements in
seismic methods, reservoir modelling techniques and laboratory
experiments (Bolourinejad, 2013} many more complex analyses
on the subject of carbon storage were performed. Combined with
enhanced oil recovery experiments (EOR), the amount of data
modelling CO, behavior underground has multiplied ten-fold,

In areas where it is not possible to implement subsurface
carbon capture, utilization strategies are discussed by Harsh, A.
et. al (2014) on the industrial usage of CO, including, but not
limited to, polymer processing and chemicals production.

For a deeper dive in the corpus, we draw an arbitrary areal
polygon, indicated by the yellow box in Figure 5, around South
East Asia. Our new database reveals some of the strategies
that have been identified by an operator to manage greenhouse
emissions in its operations in Malaysia (Mehta et.al.,2008).
This includes, among others, ending continuous gas flaring

and minimizing gas venting, improving energy efficiency in
the design of assets and production operations, accounting for
the cost of emitting greenhouse gases in investment decisions,
supporting development of CCS infrastructures, and policy
advocacy.

The rich diversity of data available in the new database
are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. These include graphical
information of PVT analyses, miscibility, flow rates, and time-
lapse pressure profiles, which are useful for reservoir simulation
studies focused on the interaction of reservoir rocks with CO,
during injection. Also available are petrography data that makes
it easier to interpret reservoir modelling results by being able
to look at the structural fabric of the storage rocks down to
microscopic levels.

New energy from old data
With this data-driven strategy it will be possible to facilitate the
pivot to new energy from valuable existing data. No part of the
data is left unprocessed. It may be that not all relevant informa-
tion will exist within the 70,000 scientific publications, but this
can be confirmed instantly saving valuable time and resources
doing data exploration. On the other hand, if the information is
available, it will be immediately accessible, trackable and put
into context with other relevant information and geographically.
For example, the geothermal gradient is a key parameter of
interest in relation to geothermal energy. The temperature data in

the new database has been acquired by energy companies mostly
for the purpose of understanding the hydrocarbon generation
window, petrophysical interpretation and reservoir modelling
analyses. They can be relooked at for further exploratory geo-
thermal applications. It currently excludes temperature data from
geothermal companies.

We are barely scratching the surface on the data and insights
available — multiple data stories are waiting to be reimagined,
reconnected and retold in the context of the future of energy.

Accelerating internal digitalization initiatives

All the elements of the new database are stored and structured
in a digital data warehouse. They will be optionally available
as an API link to be used for additional geological analysis,
data analytics, or machine learning experimentations. Already
in structured format, they can be fed into additional natural lan-
guage processing or image segmentation processing for in-house
experimentation.

Opportunity for the energy geoscientists and
engineers of the future

While the energy industry has faced significant headwinds, it is
now moving faster than ever towards new, cleaner energy pro-
duction. It is possible to see that multiple opportunities remain,
as already pointed out by Raistrick (2008), and remain relevant in
2021, for the geoscientists and engineers who are looking at the

future of energy. Strong, flexible technical skills will be needed
to explore for suitable carbon capture facilities, assess their
storage, containment and injectivity capacities. Meanwhile, the
new energy industry will continue to gather, integrate and analyse
empirical data, whether it is on the reservoir, sub-surface or at
hydrocarbon or future hydrogen production facilities.

We have already seen a lot of data. It is up to us to use the
right tools to read the earth better, and get a head start towards
new energy.
