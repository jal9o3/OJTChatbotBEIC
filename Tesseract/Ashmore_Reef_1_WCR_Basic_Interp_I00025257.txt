LOG OF SAMPLES



GEOLOGY

R.W. Craig

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK:

Field activity on the part of the oil exploration industry in
the Ashmore Reef area of the Sahul Shelf began in 1963 with the
conduct of a reconnaissance aeromagnetic survey by Aero Service
Limited on behalf of Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co. N.L. Profile
lines run in the Ashmore Reef area consisted of a northwest line to

'the reef, a northeast line to Hibernia Reef and a southeast line
back shoreward to Cartier Reef. With hindsigktit is interesting to,
Note that these broad reconnaissance data yielded a depth estimate
to magnetic basement of 7000 feet at a point immediately north of
Ashmore Reef. However, with the indications of thick sedimentary
section yielded by the following described seismic surveys, these
loosely controlled data were considered unreliable.

Initial seismic investigations of the general Ashmore Reef area
were undertaken in 1964 by B.O.C. of Australia Limited, Operator for
the Group tenement holders. Included in the seismic survey which was
shot by Western Geophysical Company of America but interpreted by
Seismograph Services Limited of London were a suite of reflection
lines around Scott and Seringapatam Reefs and a northeastern trending
step-like pattern of east-west and north-south lines which passed
south and east of Ashmore Reef.

In 1965, the Montobel lo-Mermaid Shoal seismic survey included
additlonal reflection selsmic south, cast, and north of Ashmore Reef.
These data indicated for the first time the presence of a sizeable
structure associated with Ashmore Reef.

i
i
|

Therefore the 1966 Rankin-Troubadour seismic survey included
lines which boxed in Ashmore Reef and which served to del ineate the
size, orientation and magnitude of the east-west longitudional ly
faulted Ashmore Reef anticline.

In early 1967 the Ashmore Reef shallow water marine seismic
survey was specifically undertaken to investigate the geographic
relationship between the anticlinal apex and the lagoon and islands
of the reef as well as to confirm the magnitude of southwestern
closure on the structure. As a result of this survey it was confirmed i
that the apex of the structure lay to the northeast of the reef proper i
and the islands are at considerably lower structural elevations on the
south and southwest flanks of the structure.

STRATIGRAPHY

The ages assigned the various stratigraphic units penetrated at
Ashmore Reef are based on palynological studies by B.E. Balme and on
palaeontological studies by P.J. Coleman, both of the University of
Western Australia, Perth and on micropalaeontologi cal studies by Dr.
D.J. Belford of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Canberra.

Informal stratigraphical names are put forward for three Tertiary- /
Upper Cretaceous units and for the Upper Jurassic volcanic sequence. F

the Stratigraphic Nomenclature Committee of the Geological Society
of Australia and in consideration of the following factors which
suggest the desirability and the validity of considering these units
as formational divisions:
a) The Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous sequence is the most
palaeontologically complete known to date in the Indo-Pacific region
. and therefore significant as a type section.
b) The chosen unit boundaries coincide with seismic reflections
which are mappable over a wide area of the Sahul Shelf. Less tangible
is the high degree of seismic record character continuity over intervals
representative of the units proposed.
While the terminology has been discussed with the appropriate
authorities the following names are considered as unpublished and
therefore have no standing, these should not be used in a publication
without definition and the approval of the Divisional Stratigraphic
Nomenclature Subcommittee. i

.(2818'-3062'). The base of the unit is lithologically gradational as

The details of these units are given in an appendix (Geology)
to this section of the report and are set out graphically on the
composite log of Plate 4.

Quaternary/P| iocene

Unnamed carbonates - (seabed-1053')

The Quaternary/Pl iocene sediments can be subdivided into two
lithologic units. An upper white foraminiferal limestone with minor
lamellibranchs and coral fragments persists from the sea floor (160
feet subdatum) to 540 feet (380 feet thick). These beds exhibit good
intergranular porosity, loss of circulation was experienced in the
interval 400-495 feet and the same lithology is there assumed. Between
540 feet and 1053 feet (513 feet thick) a white to cream, very fine to
fine grained calcarenite which is poorly sorted and consists of angular
calcareous fragments is the major lithology with minor crystal line
limestone interbeds.

"The basal contact is well marked on the induction electric log
by a marked increase in resistivity and on the compensated formation
density log by a sharp increase in density. Palaeontologicaliy the
contact is bracketted by possible Pliocene beds in the lower portion
of the interval 600-1000 feet (from cuttings analysis) and by a
probable late Lower but possibly early Middle Miocene age assignment
for core No.1 at 1125 feet. The contact is therefore unconformable
with Quaternary/Pliocene beds resting on Miocene beds.

Late Middle to early Lower Miocene
Unnamed carbonates - (1053'-2635')

This interval may be subdivided into two lithological units, an
upper 329 feet (1053'-1382') of white to cream foraminiferal limestone
with minor interbeds of greyish green calcareous mudstone and a lower
1253 feet (1382'-2635') of white to light brown very finely crystalline,
partly dolomitic limestone in which foraminiferal content increases
downwards.

The basal contact of these unnamed beds is well marked on the
induction electric log by a marked decrease in resistivity and on the
sonic log by an increase in interval transit time. The base of these
beds is coincident with a disconformable seismic event. Palaeontologically
the lower contact is bracketted by a Lower Miocene age assignment to I a
cores No.2 (2286'-23101) and No.3 (2619'-2632!') and by an early Lower !

. Miocene (Aquitanian or Tertiary upper "e") assignment to core No.4

(2901|'-2928'). Therefore the basal contact is believed to represent
an intra-Lower Miocene disconformity. , - :

Early Lower Miocene

Unnamed beds - (2635'-3062')

This unnamed 427 foot interval is characterized by the first down-
wards appearance of calcilutite as interbeds in a cryptocrystalline and

foraminiferal limestone (to 2818') or a mariy, foraminiferal limestone

evidenced by the marly nature of the foraminiferal limestones. It is
marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in resistivity, on

the sonic log by an increase in interval transit time, and on the
formation density log by a marked decrease in density. Seismically,
this interval is apparently confined to a local area at Ashmore
Reef. Elsewhere it is truncated by a post-early Lower Miocene
unconformity, late Lower Miocene, or younger beds rest directly

on the Oligocene 'Cartier beds'.

Oligocene
'Cartier beds! - (3062!-4009')

The 'Cartier beds' are a gradational and interbedded sequence
ot marl and shale. Mari is the sole lithology to 3413 feet (351

'teet thick) where shale interbeds first appear and become dominant

downwards to 3648 feet (235 feet thick). Shale is the sole lithology
from 3648 feet to 3887 feet (239 feet thick) where mari reappears and
becomes dominant to the base of the 'Cartier beds! at 4009 feet (122
feet thick). . i

The basal contact of the 'Cartier beds' is lithological ly
abrupt and marked on the wireline logs by a marked increase in
S.P., a marked decrease in interval transit time and decrease in
both gamma radiation and density. .

Palaeontologically Coleman has bracketted the upper contact with
an early Lower Miocene age assignment to a sidewall core at 3045 feet
and an Oligocene age assignment of a sidewall core at 3065'. Concerning
the age of the lower portion of this sequence Coleman has assigned an
Oligocene age to core No.7 (3622'-3645') and an Upper Eocene age to
:core No.8 (4040|1-4063') from just below the basal contact. Therefore
the 'Cartier beds! are considered entirely Ol igocene in age with the
possibility that the basal disconformity represents a part of the
Lower Oligocene. -

Upper Eocene-Lower Paleocene
'Hibernia beds! - (40091-6543!)

The 'Hibernia beds! are a thick (2534 feet) gradational series of
several carbonate rock types. Calcarenite prevails to 4209 feet and
remains dominant with minor interbeds of calcilutite to 4484 feet where
calcilutite prevails through to 4760 feet. Calcarenite briefly reappears
between 4760 feet and 4783 feet. The interval between 4783 and 5556
feet is an interbedded sequence of calcilutite and calcisiltite with
the calcisiltite gradational ly becoming dominant downwards. Between
5556 feet and 5730 feet calcisiltite is the sole lithologic component.
Calcilutite is the dominant lithology between 5730 feet and 6177 feet
but with minor interbeds of calcarenite and shale. “Micro- to crypto-
crystalline limestone is the dominant lithology between 6177 feet and
6543 feet but calcilutite interbeds persist downwards to about 6250
feet. The limestone becomes gradational to marl near the base. Chert
nodules and irregular thin bands are present throughout the 'Hibernia

beds'.

Due to “ie gradational nature of the composite rock types it is
not felt meaningful to subdivide the 'Hibernia beds! into lithological
units. The basal contact, although somewhat gradational, is fairly wel!
marked lithologically by the first prominent appearance of marl. The
contact is marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in both
S.P. and resistivity and on the sonic log by an increase in interval
transit time. The basal contact coincides with a strong mappable seismic

reflection. Coleman and Belford have both assigned cores No.8 (4040!-
4063!) and No.9 (4540|-4566') an Upper Eocene age. Neither palaeontologist
was successful in obtaining identifiable material from cores No.10 or 11
(5020'-5035') and (5535'-5553!).. Belford has assigned core No.12 a basal

Eocene or Upper Paleocene age and core No.13 an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman,

in contrast, has nominated a Middle to Lower Paleocene age for the interval
represented by these cores based on his tentative identifications of
several early Globorotalia species.

The formation is regarded as ranging in age through the Eocene and
part of the Paleocene.

Upper Cretaceous
'Woodbine beds! - (6543!-7956!)

The 'Woodbine beds' are a further gradational series of three basic
carbonate lithologies. Although the sequence is gradational it may be
useful! to consider the following subdivision units:

6543'-6857! (314 feet)  Marl, light green to dark grey, about 555
calcareous, slightly glauconitic, with
interbeds of white to cream microcrystal line
limestone. Calcareous shale at 6732-6739
feet.

6857'-7007' (150 feet)  Limestone, essentially as above, with
Marl interbeds below 6980 feet.

7007|-7440! (433 feet) Calcilutite and Mari

Do " Calcilutite, white to light brown, litho-
graphic, grades into light grey, light
green and dark grey marl, 65-505
calcareous, argillaceous, pyritic,
chloritic. Marl is dominant in the
interval 7188 feet to 7273 feet.

7440'-7688! (248 feet) Limestone, light brown to brown, micro-
crystalline, variable minor ferruginous
or manganese material, abundant limonite
styolites throughout and iron-rich chert
nodules towards base. :

. 7688'-7956! (268 feet) Mari, light greenish grey, 404 calcareous,
grading downwards to calcilutite, 3654
calcareous, below 7835 feet.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds' is easily recognised | ithological iy
by the abrupt change to shales below. The-induction electric log exhibits
a downwards decrease in resistivity while the gamma-sonic shows an
increase in gamma radiation and an increase in interval transit time.

The gradational relationship of the lithology of the upper portion
of the 'Woodbine beds' to the overlying 'Hibernia beds' has already been
discussed. Also, the difficulties in nominating a stage within the
Paleocene for basal 'Hibernia beds' has been pointed out. Within the
Woodbine beds' Coleman initially assigned an Upper Cretaceous age to
core No.14 (6730|-6748!) based on thin section identifications. (He
had been unable to recover free specimens from digested samples).

Beiford, however, was successful in obtaining free specimens and, as

a result, nominated an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman has since seen some

ot Belford's material and (verbal communication) concurs in a Paleocene

age assignment. Core No.15 (7252'-7267') has been assigned a Maestrichtlan
age by both workers whereas Core No.16 (7575'-7590') is regarded as
Maestrichtian by Coleman and as Santonian or Campanian by Belford. Sidewall
core from 7891 feet and cuttings between 7700 and 7950 feet were analysed
without firm results. Coleman, however, does suggest that the interval
represents the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous and possibly part of the
Lower Cretaceous as well. In the absence of firm palaeontological evidence
the writer would prefer to regard the 'Woodbine beds' as being Paleocene
through Upper Cretaceous with no Lower Cretaceous present.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds! coincides with a regional ly mappable
seismic disconformity. :

White the subdivision of the conformable and gradational sequence of
Eocene-Paleocene carbonates into two "formations", the 'Hibernia beds!
above and 'Woodbine beds' below, has been recommended on the basis of
the regional mappability of the boundary by seismic means, it is to be
emphasized that the succession is conformable and comprises several cycles
of carbonate sedimentation. i

Upper Jurassic
Unnamed sediments - (7956'-8102')

The interval 7956 feet to 8031 feet consists of dark grey to black
slightly to non-caicareous shale with very fine mica, minor pyrite and
glauconite, minor fossils, and with current bedding. The underlying
23 foet (8031'-8054!) consists of Iithic sandstone, groen to grey,
medlum grained, domInantly argil laceous with gralns of opaque volcanics
and rare quartz, fresh feldspar, fossillferous with a green highly glauconitic
matrix. The basal unit of this unnamed sedimentary sequence consists of
48 feet (8054'-8102') of light brown to greenish grey calcarenite
containing subangular to subrounded dark greenish grey volcanic fragments
and subangular hard calcite fragments in a cryptocrystal line matrix,

. slightly fossiliferous, rarely ferruginous.

Core No.17 (8016'-8023') from near the base of the shale Interval
yielded no useful macro or microfossils. However, Balme recovered spores
and pollen which are not chronologically significant but are suggestive
of a Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age. The microplankton similarly are
not accurately definitive but the genus Scrinrodinium is apparently typical
of the Upper Jurassic although a species occurs in the Lower Cretaceous of
Western Australia. On balance Balme considers "the assemblage is late
Jurassic although an early Cretaceous age is not out of the question".

Considering that this unnamed sedimentary sequence contains clastic
material derived from the underlying volcanic sequence and, considering also
the relative ages of these sediments and the underlying volcanics, it is
probable that these sequences are essentlatly conformable.

wWbj - 1141m
"Ashmore volcanic beds! - (8102'-9143")

The informally named 'Ashmore volcanic beds! may be subdivided into
two units:

8102'-8172' Altered amygdaloidal basalt, dark grey, with
phenocrysts of pyroxene and probably feldspar in

a matrix of iron oxides including haematite, and
altered feldspar. Irregular aggregates are a
mixture of green chlorite, calcite and a zeoite
and resemble amygdales.

8200'-8370!, 8540'8800!, 8850'-9073!,

and with calcite filled amygdales common in some
intervals.

Samples from core No.18 (8281'-8290!) were radiometrically dated by
the potasslum-argon method by Dr. lan McDougall of the Research School
of Physical Sciences, Department of Geophysics and Geochemistry at the
Australian National University, Canberra. He reports an age, based on
duplicate measurements, of 137.3 4 3 million years. The age obtained
can be regarded as a minimum value, owing to the deuteric alteration
in the rock some diffusive loss of radiogenic argon may have occurred
so that the true age may be a few percent older.

The presence of numerous tuffaceous interbeds attests to several
distinct volcanic flows. These individual flows may have been separated

"by several days or several million years. Accordingly, samples of core

No.19 from 8841.5 teet and 8842.5 feet were submitted to Dr. McDougall
in an attempt to determine if an appreclable portion of Jurassic time
is represented by the volcanic sequence. The two samples yielded
comparable dates at 129.4 4 3.0 million years which is regarded as

a reliable minimum age. “Tlaarly these samples have leaked more argon
than those from the higher core. This may be due to a greater degree
of alteration and/or to the greater depth and attendant higher temperatures
that core No.19 samples have experienced. Dr. McDougall concludes that
the volcanic sequence was erupted during one main volcanic episode of
relatively short duration (say several million years). The writer
concludes that it is unlikely that pre-Tithonian Jurassic beds are
present at Ashmore Reef, The 'Ashmore volcanic beds' are unconformably

:underlain by Upper Triassic beds according to Balme's age assignment of

core No.20 (9295'-9317|).

Upper Triassic
Upper unnamed Upper Triassic Clastics - (9143'-11,980")

This interval of the well contains a diversity of interbedded and
gradational predominantly clastic rock types. Sandstone grades from
rarely silty though malnly fine to medium grained but occasional ly
conglomeratic, Is subangular to subrounded, and has carbonaceous, micac ous
and argillaceous bands and Shale interbeds with similar composition ar
found between 9143 feet to 9674 feet. These beds are noticeably non-
calcareous and are taken to represent a paralic environment,

Similarly composed but slightly calcareous siltstones, sandstones
and shales are dominant from 9674 feet to 9953 feet (261 feet thick).
An occurrence of slightly quartzose calcilutite at 9742 feet to 9753
feet represents the uppermost occurrence of carbonate in the Upper
Triassic sequence. The overall Interval is slightly more marine in
aspect than the overlying.

The balance of the clastic sequ nc to 11,524 feet has the sam
accessorles and is described as only slightiy calcareous. Limestone
interb ds are pr sent. The sequ nc is regarded as paralic.

The shale between 11,524 feet and 11,657 feet (133 feet) is
up to 504 calcareous and regarded as a normal epineritic marine
deposit. The clastics from 11,657-11,980 feet are again relatively
sparse in carbonate and are regarded as parallc.

Balme has variously described cores Nos.20-25 from this interval
as "probably Upper Triassic", "consistent with Upper Triassic" and
"not likely older than Middle Triassic". On balance he considers the
sequence, at least down to 10,583 feet, to be Upper Triassic. At
11,024 feet (core No.24) Coleman has identified Costatoria suggestive
of an Upper Triassic age.

Unnamed Upper Trlassic Carbonates - (11,980'-12,703')

This interval consists of cryptocrystal line |imestone with minor
interbeds of slightly calcareous fossiliferous shale. These | ithologles
are indicative of shallow quiet water marine environment. Above 12,148
feet the upwards appearance of 33 feet of non-calcareous siltstone,
interbeds of slightiy quartzose shale and the argillaceous and quartzose
nature of the limestone itself attest to the early influx of clastic
material to the previously low energy environment.

From core No.27 (12,423'-12,433') Coleman has identified a mol luscan
fauna similar to an Upper Triassic assembiage found in Indonesia. The
gradational nature of the upper and lower contacts attest to the conformity
of the sequence and suggest the continuance of an Upper Triassic age to

total depth.

Lower Unnamed Upper Triassic Clastics - (12,703'-12,843') (T.D.)

These beds are the oldest penetrated by Ashmore Reef No.1. Therefore
it cannot be stated whether the interbedded calcareous siltstone and
sandstone with cryptocrystalline limestone and slightly calcareous shale
represent a minor clastic influx into a quiet shallow water marine environ-
ment or the closing phase of a much more extensive older clastic sequence.

Table 1 shows the regional age relationships between the section
penetrated at Ashmore Reef and rock units in the Carnarvon Basin and on

Portugese Timor.

STRUCTURE

Through the interval of unnamed early Middle to late Lower Miocene
sediments between 1053 feet and 2635 feet the Schlumberger dipmeter
recorded dips ranging from 0? to 470, The average dip of the observations
is 13.7? whereas the median observation Is 122, The median azimuth of
dip (for 569 observations) Is 0799. From seismic it is now recogni sed
that the underlying early Lower Miocene through Palaeocene rock sequence
is regionally thick and therefore Ashmore Reef was situated in a regional
low during these stages. It is interpreted that the upl 1ft required to
form the present day Ashmore Reef seismic structure began during the late
Lower-early Middle Miocene and the relatively high observed dips are due,
at least in.part to primary sedimentary dip on syntectonic clastic beds.
It Is possible, however, that in these semi-consol idated sediments, the
dipmeter is recording spurlous data and the higher magnitude dips are not

present.

The early Lower Miocene interval of 2635 feet to 3062 feet
exhibits a dipmeter baseline of dip of 20-30 with downwards decreasing
or increasing dip patterns up to a maximum dip of 202. The true
structural dip is interpreted as 22-3? to the ENE. Downwards
increasing dip patterns may be indicative of minor normal faults at
2662 feet, 2735 feet and 2756 feet.

Other dip patterns are interpreted as due to primary sedimentary
dip.

Similarly, the Ol igocene maris from 3062 feet to 4009 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip of between 0? and 22. Numerous
downwards increasing or decreasing patterns of greater dip are most
likely due to differential compaction of these plastic sediments.
Small normal faults, also attrIbutable to this cause, also may be
present.

The Eocene-Palaeocene carbonates of the interval 4009-6543 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip which increases downwards from 2?
to 50. Numerous increasing or decreasing downwards patterns of dip
are interpreted as indicative of primary sedimentary dip, although
minor normal faults may result in some of the increasing downwards
patterns. Rose diagram plots of dip azimuths suggest dip to 2790 in
the upper part. of the sequence, changing to 319? towards the base.

The Cretaceous sequence of maris and limestones from 6543 feet
to 7956 feet exhibits a pronounced dipmeter baseline of dip of 9?
down ko 6740 feet and of 12-2? from there to the base. As before,
the numerous greater dips observed fall into patterns Interpreted as

.due to primary sedimentary dip. One possible exception Is the pattern

ot increasing dips (to 90) which terminates abruptly at 7226 feet,
this could indicate a minor normal fault at that depth. Median
azimuth of baseline dips is 143?,

The thin sequence of uppermost Jurassic sediments which unconformably

underile the Upper Cretaceous sequence in the interval 7956 feet to

8102 feet exhibit a baseline of dip of 12-22 on the dipmeter. Patterns

of greater dip (up to 100) are attributed to primary sedimentary dip.
Median dip azimuth is 93?. The 'Ashmore volcanic beds' between 8102

feet and 9143 feet, as would be expected, exhibit a somewhat variable
baseline of dip of from 12 to 67. Numerous greater dips are interpreted

as due to irregular lava flow contacts. Median azimuth of dip is to the

sw.

The unnamed Upper Triassic clastic sequence from 9143 feet to
11,980 feet exhibits a baseline of dip between 3 and 10? with extremely
numerous patterns of greater dip (up to 240) indicative of primary
sedimentary dip. Median azimuth of both the baseline of dip and of
#he sedimentary dip patterns is southeast. The Upper Triassic carbonates
between 11,980 feet and 12,703 feet have a baseline of dip at 12 to #?.
Median azimuth of these dip observations is 2450, Numerous patterns of
greater dip are interpreted as due to primary dip, these have a median
azimuth of 140?. The deepest Upper Triassic beds drilled between 12,703
feet and 12,843 feet exhibit a baseline of dip between 12 and 5? with a
median dip azimuth of 520, Greater dips are interpreted of sedimentary
origin, median azimuth of these Is 1130,

The dipmeter results agree with the observations of dip in
recovered cores (see Table of Observed Dips). The low magnitude of
dips and varlability of dip azimuth throughout the Lower Miocene to
Upper Cretaceous rock units suggests that the well was located very
near the apex of the Ashmore Reef anticline. Jurassic beds have a
slightly steeper structural dip (8 62) as do those of the Upper
Triassic clastics (2107), respective southwesterly and southeasterly
median azimuths of dip apply. ' 1t therefore could be argued that the
well is consierably downdip in a southerly direction from the
structural apex in rocks of these ages. However, due to the presence
of the major down-to-the-north, northeasterly trending normal fauit
located approximately 1 mile north of the well, it is unlikely that
a significant area of higher structural elevation is present.

RELEVANCE TO OCCURRENCE OF PETROLEUM

Hydrocarbon Shows

No signs of liquid hydrocarbon were observed in the Ashmore Reef
No.1 well.

The only indications of gas from the mud analyser were of a very
minor nature and occurred while drilling the Upper Jurassic 'Ashmore

@mamapa maa

volcanic beds', especially from the upper interval of altered amygdalol dal
basalt. Between 8152 feet and 8174 feet percentages of 1.35 methane and
0.0468 ethane were recorded. Intermittent shows of methane up to 0.475
persisted to a depth of 8885 feet. Thereafter trip gas containing up to
18 methane and nitrogen was observed during drilling to total depth. The
magnitude of these gas indications was insufficient to warrant testing
which was not recommended.

Porosity and Permeabi li ty

intervals of good porosity and permeability were encountered in the
Quaternary, early Middle to late Lower Miocene, early Lower Miocene,
Eocene-Paleocene, and Upper Triassic rock sequences.

Porosity logs were not run on the Quaternary foraminiferal |Imeston
“ and calcarenite above 978 feet. However, these posed continuing lost
circulation problems during drilling and are presumably highly porous
and permeable. Between 978 and 1053 feet these beds have log-indicated
porosities of 31-325.

The early Middle to late Lower Miocene log porosities between 1053
| and 2635 feet vary from 22 to 355 (see log interpretation for greater
detail). Core No.2 from 2286 feet to 2310 feet revealed similar
porosities of 21 to 358 with permeabilities of between 15 and 1134
millidarcies. Core No.3 of the interval 2619 to 2644 feet analysed
between 19 and 245 porosity and 0.96 to 5.44 millidarcies.

The Eocene calcarenites of the 'Hibernia beds' in the interval
“4009 to 4484 feet exhibit sonic log porosities of between 20-275
porosity and average 238. Core No.8 of the interval 4036-4063 feet

Igneous Activity

The occurrence of Upper Jurassic volcanics in the interval 8102
feet to 9143 feet is only detrimental to petroleum prospects in this
and older age sediments insofar that associated volcanic necks and
presumably present assoclated dykes and sills may have broken up any
pre-existing oil migration pattern. Although the corresponding seismic
interval of high energy dies out rapidly at Ashmore Reef, this does not
preclude the reglonal presence of additional volcanic sequences in the
Sahul Shelf area.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

Virtuaily every aspect of geologic Information from as remote a

significant contributions to geological knowledge are:

Upper Cretaceous sequence of terrigenous-poor sediment

palaeontologists as possibly the most complete in a time-
rock sense yet revealed in the Indo-Pacific region.
Nevertheless, sharp lithological boundaries and possible
faunal gaps tend to support the selsmic record sectlon
evidence of unconformable/disconformable relationships
of the Oligocene 'Cartier beds' marls to the underlying
Eocene-Paleocene 'Hibernia beds!'. Furthermore, the
seismic interval isochron map of the Tertiary portion
of this 'paraconformable' sequence suggests Ashmore Reef
to be in a depositional synclinal position, during
those times, within the general Sahul Shelf area.

(b) The uplift which produced the Ashmore Reef anticlinal
structure was post-early Middle Miocene In age.

(c) The apparent absence of Lower Cretaceous sediments or
appreciable Jurassic sediments sets the Ashmore Reef
area apart from either Timor or the Carnarvon Basin.
Due to the angular unconformity on seismic records at
the base of the Uppermost Jurassic volcanics, this
uplifting phase of the area probably occurred in pre-
late Jurassic but post-late Triassic times. The area
remained above wave base (except for a minor phase at
the close of Jurassic) until Upper Cretac ous times.

The presence of the thick incompletely drilled sequence
of Upper Trlassic beds is problematical because of
their clastic character and southeasterly sedimentary
dip. Thus a clastic source area must be Invoked in the
area northwest of Ashmore Reef. However, the Ladinian
through Norian Aitutu formation In Portugese Timor
comprises 804 calcilutite, 158 shales and only 52
calcarenites, quartz arenites and radiolarites., Thus
the postulated landmass northwest of Ashmore did not
contribute significant amounts of clastic material to
Portugese Timor.

The presence of Upper Jurassic vo|canics are not
serlously detrimental to petroleum prospects In older
beds. The areal distribution of these volcanics on
the Sahul Shelf is unknown.

Rocks at Ashmore Reef No.l which were found porous and
hence are.regionally potential reservoir rocks on the
Sahul Shelf are the upper calcarenite facies of the
'Hibernia beds! and the upper portion of the unnamed
Upper Triassic clastic sequence. The porous Miocene
beds could be prospective In other parts of the Sahul
Shelf if these can be found beneath an effective cap
rock.

27th November. 1967 M.J.W. Lofting/T.C. Tyner.

|. INTERPRETAT ION

The hole was logged using a seawater mud having a salinity of approximately
29,000 ppm. NaCI.

The following tools were: run:-

Induction-Electrical 983-3650 ft. Run No.2

B.H.C. Sonic 983-3634 ft. Run No.2
B.H.C. Formation Density 983-3644 ft. Run No.1
. Proximity/Microlog 983-3644 ft. Run No.1
Dipmeter 983-3630 ft. Run No.1

The Gamma Ray tool failed to function which was unfortunate as a direct shale
reading would have been useful. Ei

The interval 1168-985 feet is badly washed out in bands and quantitative
interpretation in this interval is difficult. The interval 1168-2635 feet

is remarkably close to gauge and is suitable for quantitative work. The

interval 2635-3650 is more shaly and the hole averages about 13 inches
“diameter. A slight drift on the S.P. is present but most of the magnetism
- seen on Run No.1 has been removed.

ks

Il. NOTES
(a) Rw

There is no S.P. deflection throughout most of the logged interval
indicating that Rw and Rmf are very close. The calculated
formation water salinity is in the order of 30,000 ppm NaC|.

Two zones immediately below 2635 feet give moderately high salinity “
and below this depth a marked positive shitt in the S.P. base line
occurs.

(b) Rt

The induction curve which approximates Rt is generally less than
4 ohm but shows thin peaks up to 4.5 ohms over tight zones.

(Cc) Porosity

Porosities as determined from Formation Density are generally
lower than those derived from the Sonic Log due to shaliness .
and possibly due to lack of consolidation. A slight decrease
in sonic transit time on the Sonic Log between 1380 ft. and
2635 ft. suggests increased compaction while on the Formation
H . Density Log a marked decrease in average bulk density suggests
i a marked increase in compaction.

GEOLOGY

R.W. Craig

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK:

Field activity on the part of the oil exploration industry in
the Ashmore Reef area of the Sahul Shelf began in 1963 with the
conduct of a reconnaissance aeromagnetic survey by Aero Service
Limited on behalf of Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co. N.L. Profile
lines run in the Ashmore Reef area consisted of a northwest line to

'the reef, a northeast line to Hibernia Reef and a southeast line
back shoreward to Cartier Reef. With hindsigktit is interesting to,
Note that these broad reconnaissance data yielded a depth estimate
to magnetic basement of 7000 feet at a point immediately north of
Ashmore Reef. However, with the indications of thick sedimentary
section yielded by the following described seismic surveys, these
loosely controlled data were considered unreliable.

Initial seismic investigations of the general Ashmore Reef area
were undertaken in 1964 by B.O.C. of Australia Limited, Operator for
the Group tenement holders. Included in the seismic survey which was
shot by Western Geophysical Company of America but interpreted by
Seismograph Services Limited of London were a suite of reflection
lines around Scott and Seringapatam Reefs and a northeastern trending
step-like pattern of east-west and north-south lines which passed
south and east of Ashmore Reef.

In 1965, the Montobel lo-Mermaid Shoal seismic survey included
additlonal reflection selsmic south, cast, and north of Ashmore Reef.
These data indicated for the first time the presence of a sizeable
structure associated with Ashmore Reef.

i
i
|

Therefore the 1966 Rankin-Troubadour seismic survey included
lines which boxed in Ashmore Reef and which served to del ineate the
size, orientation and magnitude of the east-west longitudional ly
faulted Ashmore Reef anticline.

In early 1967 the Ashmore Reef shallow water marine seismic
survey was specifically undertaken to investigate the geographic
relationship between the anticlinal apex and the lagoon and islands
of the reef as well as to confirm the magnitude of southwestern
closure on the structure. As a result of this survey it was confirmed i
that the apex of the structure lay to the northeast of the reef proper i
and the islands are at considerably lower structural elevations on the
south and southwest flanks of the structure.

STRATIGRAPHY

The ages assigned the various stratigraphic units penetrated at
Ashmore Reef are based on palynological studies by B.E. Balme and on
palaeontological studies by P.J. Coleman, both of the University of
Western Australia, Perth and on micropalaeontologi cal studies by Dr.
D.J. Belford of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Canberra.

Informal stratigraphical names are put forward for three Tertiary- /
Upper Cretaceous units and for the Upper Jurassic volcanic sequence. F

The 9-5/8" casing shoe was located at 8140 ft. and the bottom of the
83" hole was logged at 10,171 ft.

The memoriser of the conductivity curve failed during the Induction
Electric Survey and a re-run was made. During the Sonic/Gamma Ray/
Caliper Survey a hydraulic pressure leak caused the tension to slack
off in the Rucker Compensating System, and resulted in unacceptable
errors in the depth scale of the Schlumberger logs. After repairs to.
the hydraulic system the survey was re-run.

"The survoys wore Initially Intondod for consolldatlon purposes but
examination of the |.E.S. suggested certain lithological anomalies.
To resolve these problems the Formation Density Log and sidewall cores .
were added to the programme. After taking 17 cores a fault in the
electrical circuits terminated the operation and remaining cores will
be taken during the next surveys.

Below the 9-5/8" shoe, down to 9138 feet, the hole is washed out to-

NI. CONCLUS IONS

The following interval velocities were calculated from the integrated
sonic log. 5

Thickness Travel-Time Velocity

JInterval (fr.) Ft.) (m-sec.) (ft./sec)

The surveys revealed firstly, that the interbedded volcanics logged: in
drill cuttings below 9400 feet are not present and secondly that. U
areanaceous beds extend upwards to at least 9143 feet.

The interval between 9143 feet and 8950 feet cannot be shale because k
of its low radioactivity and is probably weather basalt or tuff but) “v
final definition must await confirmatory sidewall cores during the
next log run.

The foilowing general subdivisions are tentatively proposed:-

Unit A 8140 - 8950 Volcanics - definitely
8950 - 9143 Volcanics - possibly tuft.

Unit B 9143 - 9675 Sandstone, massive very fine grained
| (Sand/Shale Ratio 1:0.61)

unit C 9675 - 10170 Siltstones with massive beds very fine
" grained sandstone and occasional bands
calcilutite. (Sand/Shale ratio 1:1.9)

The cavings from the volcanics present below the 9-5/8" casing have:
badiy contaminated the underiying succession to an extent not
realised while drilling. While drilling, the extremely fine grained
sandstones were broken up and the grains passed completely through
the screens. Normally this would have been recorded .in the flow line
'mud sample, but with the high mud volumes and slow penetration rate,
the sand quantities did not rise above 15. :

G) The logged interval is entirely water bearing. The salinity
of the water is approximately 85,000 ppm.

(ii) Three lithostratigraphic units are suggested although final
definition must await further sidewall cores. It is certain
that there are no interbedded voicanics below 9400 feet and
it is very probable that volcanics are absent below 9143 feet.

The details of these units are given in an appendix (Geology)
to this section of the report and are set out graphically on the
composite log of Plate 4.

Quaternary/P| iocene

Unnamed carbonates - (seabed-1053')

The Quaternary/Pl iocene sediments can be subdivided into two
lithologic units. An upper white foraminiferal limestone with minor
lamellibranchs and coral fragments persists from the sea floor (160
feet subdatum) to 540 feet (380 feet thick). These beds exhibit good
intergranular porosity, loss of circulation was experienced in the
interval 400-495 feet and the same lithology is there assumed. Between
540 feet and 1053 feet (513 feet thick) a white to cream, very fine to
fine grained calcarenite which is poorly sorted and consists of angular
calcareous fragments is the major lithology with minor crystal line
limestone interbeds.

"The basal contact is well marked on the induction electric log
by a marked increase in resistivity and on the compensated formation
density log by a sharp increase in density. Palaeontologicaliy the
contact is bracketted by possible Pliocene beds in the lower portion
of the interval 600-1000 feet (from cuttings analysis) and by a
probable late Lower but possibly early Middle Miocene age assignment
for core No.1 at 1125 feet. The contact is therefore unconformable
with Quaternary/Pliocene beds resting on Miocene beds.

Late Middle to early Lower Miocene
Unnamed carbonates - (1053'-2635')

This interval may be subdivided into two lithological units, an
upper 329 feet (1053'-1382') of white to cream foraminiferal limestone
with minor interbeds of greyish green calcareous mudstone and a lower
1253 feet (1382'-2635') of white to light brown very finely crystalline,
partly dolomitic limestone in which foraminiferal content increases
downwards.

The basal contact of these unnamed beds is well marked on the
induction electric log by a marked decrease in resistivity and on the
sonic log by an increase in interval transit time. The base of these
beds is coincident with a disconformable seismic event. Palaeontologically
the lower contact is bracketted by a Lower Miocene age assignment to I a
cores No.2 (2286'-23101) and No.3 (2619'-2632!') and by an early Lower !

. Miocene (Aquitanian or Tertiary upper "e") assignment to core No.4

(2901|'-2928'). Therefore the basal contact is believed to represent
an intra-Lower Miocene disconformity. , - :

Early Lower Miocene

Unnamed beds - (2635'-3062')

This unnamed 427 foot interval is characterized by the first down-
wards appearance of calcilutite as interbeds in a cryptocrystalline and

foraminiferal limestone (to 2818') or a mariy, foraminiferal limestone

evidenced by the marly nature of the foraminiferal limestones. It is
marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in resistivity, on

The formation test at 9230 feet recovered 10750 ccs of mud filtrate
and 2250 ces of mixture of 10 - 135 formation water and 90 - 879 mud

salinities of the sample, mud filtrate and the formation water. The
salinity of the formation water is derived from the SP curve.

Maximum formation pressure measured was 4120 p.s.i.

Permeability was calculated to be 2.75 mds. This very low figure is
presumably caused by "mudding" of the formation adjacent to the

borehole.” It is very likely that if a conventional production test
was conducted the formation would be cleaned up and a more reasonable
permeability would be indicated. " .

formation water is 100,000 ppm NaCl above 12,200 feet and 50,000 ppm,

VELOCITY SURVEY

ASHMORE REEF NO.! WELL
by
B.O.C. OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED

Introduction

. B.O.C. of Australia Limited contracted Western Geophysical Company
of America to perform the velocity survey. Under the contract Western
agreed to furnish the following:

Two Gulf-type Model GCE101 Pressure Sensitive Well Geophones
One Amplitfier case including 12 S.I.E. P-11l Amplifier channels
One Amplifier case including 2 Water Break Amplifiers

One S.|.E. PRO-11 Camera with 12 gal vanometer elements

Two battery type blasters

Two Kaar TR327 radios (Citizens Band type)

One portable developing system

Necessary power supplies, cabling etc.

In addition Western furnished one observer and one shooter. The
survey was conducted on the 23rd and 24th of March 1968, at times
convenient for the well operation.

Survey Procedures

The survey was conducted in very calm weather and at the Neap Tide
period, when the tidal variations of the water level were very small. .

1. Shot Positioning

The shots were fired to the northeast and southwest of the well.
A reference geophone was lowered 25 teet below the water in the moonpool
of the rig and was used to record the water break. The distances that

shots were fired from the well were calculated from the water break times.

2. Explosives

Fifty pound charges of Dupont Nitromon WW were used for ali well
geophone stations. The majority of shot to well distances were between
1500 and 2000 feet.

' 3. Well Geophone Positioni ng

All depth measurements were made using the Schlumberger depth
indicator and | compensat ions were made for the tidal variations of the
sea.

The following procedure was used to keep the geophone stationary
in the bore hole when the shots were fired: “the marine riser was
disconnected from the derrick tfioor and lowered to the casing top,
the Schlumberger cable was clamped with a T-bar device and the cable
was lowered until the T-bar rested on top of the marine riser.

Instrumentation

The seismic instruments were set up behind the Schlumberger unit,
on the port side of the upper deck on the "Investigator". The location
permitted good communication with Schlumberger and the derrick floor.
Eight traces were utilised on the survey records. Traces 1 through 4
monitored the well geophone at four different gain levels. Traces 5
and 6 monitored the well reference geophone in the moonpool.' The time
break was recorded on trace 7. Trace 8 was used for the 100 cycle
timing checker trace. On the amplitfiers receiving signals from the
well geophone, wide band filtering, and fixed-gain recording mode were


-2-

used throughout the survey. :.The master gain levels were varied betw n
shots in anticipation of the signal strengths to b recorded. Signals
from the well reference geophone in the moonpool were passed through the
.two specially designed water break amplitiers.

.Resulis

. Shots were fired with the well geophone stationed at sixteen differ nt
levels, ranging from 1360 to 12,710 feet below the Mean Low Water Spring
tide datum. Check shots from opposing. sides of the well were obtained at
five different levels.

The results of the velocity survey have been shown on the attach d:
computation sheet and graph. The record quality varied from good fo
questionable, the majority being fair. Adequate check shots were obtain d-
:'to yleld a reliable survey. JUD). o KURO

. Conclusions a o

(1) The velocity survey will provide identification for the seismic
reflection horizons recorded in the vicinity of the well.

(2) The velocity survey data comparable to the integrated Sonic Log data, .
show fairly good overall agreement. .|t is felt that where the Sonic Logs.
are of good quality, a limited number of check shots, with the gecphon “a
stationed at intervals In excess of 2,000 feet, would be sufficient to
:provide absolute times to tie the Integrated Sonic data.

the sonic log by an increase in interval transit time, and on the
formation density log by a marked decrease in density. Seismically,
this interval is apparently confined to a local area at Ashmore
Reef. Elsewhere it is truncated by a post-early Lower Miocene
unconformity, late Lower Miocene, or younger beds rest directly

on the Oligocene 'Cartier beds'.

Oligocene
'Cartier beds! - (3062!-4009')

The 'Cartier beds' are a gradational and interbedded sequence
ot marl and shale. Mari is the sole lithology to 3413 feet (351

'teet thick) where shale interbeds first appear and become dominant

downwards to 3648 feet (235 feet thick). Shale is the sole lithology
from 3648 feet to 3887 feet (239 feet thick) where mari reappears and
becomes dominant to the base of the 'Cartier beds! at 4009 feet (122
feet thick). . i

The basal contact of the 'Cartier beds' is lithological ly
abrupt and marked on the wireline logs by a marked increase in
S.P., a marked decrease in interval transit time and decrease in
both gamma radiation and density. .

Palaeontologically Coleman has bracketted the upper contact with
an early Lower Miocene age assignment to a sidewall core at 3045 feet
and an Oligocene age assignment of a sidewall core at 3065'. Concerning
the age of the lower portion of this sequence Coleman has assigned an
Oligocene age to core No.7 (3622'-3645') and an Upper Eocene age to
:core No.8 (4040|1-4063') from just below the basal contact. Therefore
the 'Cartier beds! are considered entirely Ol igocene in age with the
possibility that the basal disconformity represents a part of the
Lower Oligocene. -

Upper Eocene-Lower Paleocene
'Hibernia beds! - (40091-6543!)

The 'Hibernia beds! are a thick (2534 feet) gradational series of
several carbonate rock types. Calcarenite prevails to 4209 feet and
remains dominant with minor interbeds of calcilutite to 4484 feet where
calcilutite prevails through to 4760 feet. Calcarenite briefly reappears
between 4760 feet and 4783 feet. The interval between 4783 and 5556
feet is an interbedded sequence of calcilutite and calcisiltite with
the calcisiltite gradational ly becoming dominant downwards. Between
5556 feet and 5730 feet calcisiltite is the sole lithologic component.
Calcilutite is the dominant lithology between 5730 feet and 6177 feet
but with minor interbeds of calcarenite and shale. “Micro- to crypto-
crystalline limestone is the dominant lithology between 6177 feet and
6543 feet but calcilutite interbeds persist downwards to about 6250
feet. The limestone becomes gradational to marl near the base. Chert
nodules and irregular thin bands are present throughout the 'Hibernia

beds'.

Due to “ie gradational nature of the composite rock types it is
not felt meaningful to subdivide the 'Hibernia beds! into lithological
units. The basal contact, although somewhat gradational, is fairly wel!
marked lithologically by the first prominent appearance of marl. The
contact is marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in both
S.P. and resistivity and on the sonic log by an increase in interval
transit time. The basal contact coincides with a strong mappable seismic

FORAMINIFERAL LIMESTONE.

porosity is present.

DESCRIPTION

LIMESTONE, white to cream, fragments vary
from fine to very coarse, minor fossil
fragments mainly foraminifera, good inter-
granular and vugular porosity.

Two types are
present with both grading into each other.

(1) White to cream, composed of cream
caicareous clastics (1 mm. to maximum of
2 cms.) and foraminifera (405 of rock) as
well as minor fragments of light grey to
light blue calcareous clastics. All are
set in a light brown to cream calcareous
cement which contains significant numbers
of small well formed calcite or dolomite
crystals. Good intergranular and vugular,
porosity is present throughout. Semi-
consol idated.

(2) Light brown, composed of up to 608
forams generally white, minor black ones.
Porosity is fair to poor and mostly
vugular. Harder than type (1). No
petroleum indications.

CALCILUTITE, light grey to light brown
crossed horizontal ly by large numbers of
white and dark grey calcareous streaks.
Fossils (304 foraminifera) generally lie
parallel to colour bands. Approximately

405 of the rock is cream calcareous clastics
set in a light grey to light brown cement or
matrix, poor vugular porosity, interbedded
with Coquinite light and dark grey, hard,
well compacted grading into the calcilutite.
Foraminifera are present with the two large
torams dominant. (One is biconvex and tends
to distort the other disc shaped type. The
latter is dominant and has distinct concentric
ornament. Increasing numbers of a black
biconvex foram are present towards the base.
Porosity poor. 1t is probable that there is
little to no dip.

CALCILUTITE: white to light grey, generally
clay sized with the white zones rich in silt
sized calcite grains. From 2907 to 2912 ft.
and 2916 to 2923 ft. there are large numbers
of very thin disc shaped foramini fera with
their long axes mainly parallel and extending
across core. Often they are present in
clusters and are then randomly orientated.

In areas between the abovementioned bands
very fine fossils are present. No obvious
Dip is probably horizontal.

. SHALE: grey, fissile, silty in part, argilla-

ceous, slightly micaceous and up to 258
calcareous with very fine unidentifiable
fossil fragments as well as minor foraminifera
often replaced by pyrite. Towards the base,
areas of light grey fragments of micro-
crystalline limestone occur up to 2" across,
generally partly rounded with a sharp contact
with the surrounding Shale. These are probably
clastics and are much harder than the Shale.
The fissility would indicate probably zero
dip. No indication of hydrocarbons.

CALCARENITE: white to light brown, granular,
with equal amounts of silt sized, very fine
grained and fine grained, calcareous clastics,
slightly dolomitic and fossiliferous with thin
bands rich in elongated fragments, possibly

fossil remains, good to fair intergranular

porosity.

A possible break in deposition occurs at 4059'6"
where there is a sharp break downwards from
white to light blue calcareous material. This
grades back to the white to light brown type by

.4060'6"., Above this disconformity are very

thin laminations of black possibly carbonaceous
and or ferruginous material which are primary
bedding structures. Secondary structures or
Styolites are present throughout. All styolites
show only minor irregularity, i.e. they do not
appear as a wriggly trace but as a straight or
curved line.

Dip: Nil, strong odour of HS when core is
broken.

CALCILUTITE: white to cream, microcrystal line,
almost entirely calcareous with fossils common

:throughout. Porosity is fair to poor and is

probably intergranular and vugular. Most vugs
seen are associated with fossils. Chemical
structures including nodules and styolites

are present throughout. Nodules composed
entirely of Chert are found in the top six

feet of the core. They vary from 5" to 4"
across. They have a regular outline but are
often branching. Styolites are rare and poorly
developed. Towards the base, zones enriched
with glauconite or chlorite are present. The
basal and most outstanding zone has a sharp
upper contact with the base grading back into
the Calcilutite. Large amounts of. pyrite often
in cubes are present in this zone which extends
across most of the core.

Fossils include Pelecypods, Foramini fera and
Crustacea. No apparent dip, strong sulphide
odour when core is broken. .

poor and where present is a result of
tracturing. This is particularly apparent

at the base of the core where there is a
slickenslide coated with clear crystals of
dolomite. Throughout.the core but more
concentrated in the top foot are laminations
slightly darker than the surrounding material,

still very caicareous and probably due to
increasing amounts of carbonaceous or argilla-
ceous material. These are completely irregular

and change shape and direction consi derably.
Also present throughout are well developed

styolites.

Dip: probably horizontal with a strong

. sulphide odour when core is broken.

CALCILUTITE: light buff grey, dense, tough,
composed essentially of calcareous mud,

probably mainly of clastic rather than chemical
origin, small fraction of quartzose silt, non
calcareous clay and silt sized grains of a black
mineral dispersed through the rock, calcareous
cement: irregular bands and patches of very

fine grained Calcarenite (a slightly coarser
version of the Calcilutite) and of small streaks
of dark grey and black carbonaceous material,
indicate a lack of dip or very low dip. Light
bluish grey nodules of Chert with off-white
haloes and irregular to rounded shapes commonly
less than an inch across are scattered through-
out the core, the nodules which are only slightly
calcaroous are of secondary origin. The core Is
intersected by many irregular fractures whIch
commonly dips at high angles: fracture planes
show developed slickensides which impari a
styolitic appearance, fracture planes are

lined with fine calcite crystals and a dark
carbonaceous material. lIntergranular porosity
is very poor.

LIMESTONE: mottled light greenish-grey, massive,
tight, microcrystal line with scattered lath-like
aggregates (mainly less than 4" long) of very
finely crystalline pyrite and other dark minerals:
the laths are surrounded by very light green
limestone (suggesting secondary origin ? replace-
ment of organic matter) which gives the rock a
faint mottling, the laths are elongate, both
normal and parallel to the length of the core.
Very thin wavy and sub-horizontal laminae of

dark Shale appear noticeably at about 6024 teet,
the laminae become more obvious downwards and

at 6025.5 feet, several Shale laminae in a zone
about 1" thick are present. The SHALE is firm
to hard, fissile, calcareous and slightly pyritic,
silty, carbonaceous and micaceous. The Limestone
grades downwards into CALCILUTITE which is semi-
crystalline. in the upper part only. It grades
from very light greenish-grey to creamy-buff,

it consists of calcareous mud and silt (partly
recrystallised in the upper part) bound into a
firm rock with calcareous cement, quartzose

silt and non-calcareous clay form about 10-205

of the rock, silt-sized grains of pyrite and a

'black mineral are scattered through the rock.

Several zones, up to 4" thick, of wavy
laminations and streaks of dark Shale are
present, the zones are commonly associated
with well-developed styolites. The
calcilutite shows several small-scale
sedimentational structures including load-
casts, convolutions and flame structures,
shaly laminae are depressed below and arched
over, pillow-like structures, which appear to
be load-casts, the sedimentational structures
give the rock a faint mottling. Several | ight
grey rounded CHERT nodules, about an inch
across, are present in the calcilutite, one
nodule has a styolitic boundary with the host
rock and shaly laminae are arched over it.

At about 6037 feet several dark bluish patches
with irreguiar outl ines, consist in part of

:crystals of calcite and very finely crystal line

pyrite, with rims highly concentrated in pyrite,
the origin of the bluish colour is unknown.
Irregular fractures intersect the calcilutite

at high angles, the fractures are lined with
calcite in places. The shaly laminae indicate
negligible dip. Very poor intergranular porosity
is probably present in the non-crystal l ine
calcilutite.

Fracture porosity is also present.

LIMESTONE: with minor thin beds enriched with
argi llaceous material.
Limestone, white to cream, made up mainly of

“clay or smaller than clay sized particles with

large amounts of microcrystalline calcite and

up to 206 argillaceous material, slightly

pyritic associated with a black metallic like
mineral, very minor carbonaceous material and
clear angular quartz grains. Porosity is poor

to nil and due entirely to fractures. Approxi-
mately vertical fractures often less than j"
apart are present throughout. Brecciated zones
associated with these are also present. Crystals
of calcite are often present along these fractures.
Evidence of faulting in the form of a pronounced
slickenside surface is present at 6524'. This
runs at an angle of 40 degrees and has a coating
of argillaceous material. Running parallel with
this are a number of minor fractures. The Lime-
stone is compact dnd hard. Argillaceous rich
bands up to 3" thick are present throughout with
an upper gradational surface with the Limestone
and generally a sharp lower boundary. Thin
argil laceous and possibly carbonaceous lamel lae
are present with no less than 654 calcareous
material. “These lamellae can be extremely thin
and irregular in shape and extent. They indicate
a possible dip of up to 10 degrees.

CALCILUTITE' white to cream, entirely clay sized,
hard with 904 calcareous material, minor pyrite
and quartz, rare glauconite and fossils. Porosi ty
is poor to nil. Two Styolites are present both
approximately 4" thick and both made up of partly
calcareous, argillaceous and phosphatic material.
No fracturing is present in this interval.

CALCAREQOUS SHALE, grey to green with all
particles clay sized, fissile, slightly
glauconitic and pyritic, up to 258 calcareous
material. All pieces disintegrate readily.
Dark streaks bearing no relation to the
bedding are present throughout. These have
a greater calcareous content than the
surrounding material. 1t is possible that
some of glauconite present has replaced the
original forams. There is a sharp break
with the overlying calcilutite which is
probably a disconformity only.

MARL, grey entirely clay sized, fissile with
less glauconite than previous interval, minor
pyrite with up to 508 calcareous material. It
is also harder and does not disintegrate as
readily as the previous interval. Slickenside
surfaces indicating minor faulting is present
in both argi | laceous intervals.

MARL grading into thin beds of CALCILUTITE.

MARL: light and dark grey, grading from equally
calcareous and argil laceous to 755 calcareous,
fissile pyritic with large grains of pyrite up

to an inch in diameter, also replacing or
infilling fossils, minor amounts of flaky
elongated chiorite. This is probably chamosite
and replaces compressed fossil remains.
individual beds or laminae of marl with the

same calcareous content are generally thin

i.e. the core is composed of a large number of
thin grey and dark grey areas with the dark
grey,areas containing increased amounts of
argillaceous material. Boundaries are grada-
tional. lrregularly shaped darker areas are
also common and were probably pockets of more
argillaceous o0zes. Often these are composed

of predominantly silt sized material. Unidentifi-
able fossil. remains and foraminifera are present
throughout.

CALCILUTITE: white to light grey, probably rarely
crystalline, composed almost entirely of clay
sized material, approximately 808 calcareous
with most of the remainder argillaceous, partly
pyritic with fossils common, also containing
darker irregular bodies of more argi | laceous
material as present in the Marl. The upper
boundaries of the Calcilutite beds (range up to
6" thick) are quite often sharp while there is
always a gradation of the lower boundary into a
Mari.

A zone of Marl at 7260! indicates a dip of
approx. 2-3 degrees as well as minor compaction
before the deposition of the overlying rock.

The water current appears to have eroded this
surface forming a microintraformational breccia
above the darker Mari.

are present as dark brown calcareous outl ines
infilled with the microcrystal line groundmass.
This groundmass contains numerous dark brown
calcite. fragments which vary from 0.5mm down
to approx. the same size as the surrounding
material.

Styolites are present throughout particularly
in the darker zones in which there can be up
to four per foot. They vary in thickness
from very thin traces up to 3" thick and are
composed entirely of limonite. Any colour
changes in the Limestone occurs across these
styolites. On rare occasions crystals of

dfibrous calcite also occur in the styolites.

Vertical fractures are common and offen only
3" apart. A fault plane is present at the

'base of the core associated with minor

brecciation as well as fibrous calcite

“recrystallization along the fault plane. A

slickenside surface is also associated with
this fault.

Porosity is poor and never exceeds 105. 1t"

SHALE: dark grey 'to black, hard, massive when
fresh but fissile when dry, occasional shell
fragments and crinoids, otherwise only very
slightly calcareous or non-calcareous, very
fine mica flakes throughout, rare pods of
pyrite, glauconitic, current bedded.

BASALT: black, composed predominantly of black

and green phenocrysts of pyroxene and olivine

set in a black pyroxene and felspathic ground-
mass. No other minerals including quartz appear
to be present. The core is completely homogenous
except for an irregularly shaped zone of chlorite
and calcite approx. 3" thick at 8285! and a Im
thick darker and finer grained bed of volcanic
material at the base of the core. Surrounding
this irregular vein of chlorite and calcite, the
Fock has been altered to a light brown colour.
The alteration extends no more than 3" into the
volcanic material. 5

The dark band at the base of the core would
indicate that the dip does not exceed 5 degrees.

WEATHERED BASALT: dark grey, hard but containing
large numbers. of very thin hairlike fractures
mostiy filled with a light blue-green mineral,
also contains quite large numbers of irregularly
shaped vesicles and amygdales of calcite. All
tend to be elongated at approx. 45 degrees to
the axis of the core. The groundmass is black
and contains numerous grains of a black mineral
rarely greater than | mm. across. These tend
to be lineated in approx. the same direction

as the elongated amygdales mentioned above.

The fractures are probably due to movement of
the lava just prior to solidification.

reflection. Coleman and Belford have both assigned cores No.8 (4040!-
4063!) and No.9 (4540|-4566') an Upper Eocene age. Neither palaeontologist
was successful in obtaining identifiable material from cores No.10 or 11
(5020'-5035') and (5535'-5553!).. Belford has assigned core No.12 a basal

Eocene or Upper Paleocene age and core No.13 an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman,

in contrast, has nominated a Middle to Lower Paleocene age for the interval
represented by these cores based on his tentative identifications of
several early Globorotalia species.

The formation is regarded as ranging in age through the Eocene and
part of the Paleocene.

Upper Cretaceous
'Woodbine beds! - (6543!-7956!)

The 'Woodbine beds' are a further gradational series of three basic
carbonate lithologies. Although the sequence is gradational it may be
useful! to consider the following subdivision units:

6543'-6857! (314 feet)  Marl, light green to dark grey, about 555
calcareous, slightly glauconitic, with
interbeds of white to cream microcrystal line
limestone. Calcareous shale at 6732-6739
feet.

6857'-7007' (150 feet)  Limestone, essentially as above, with
Marl interbeds below 6980 feet.

7007|-7440! (433 feet) Calcilutite and Mari

Do " Calcilutite, white to light brown, litho-
graphic, grades into light grey, light
green and dark grey marl, 65-505
calcareous, argillaceous, pyritic,
chloritic. Marl is dominant in the
interval 7188 feet to 7273 feet.

7440'-7688! (248 feet) Limestone, light brown to brown, micro-
crystalline, variable minor ferruginous
or manganese material, abundant limonite
styolites throughout and iron-rich chert
nodules towards base. :

. 7688'-7956! (268 feet) Mari, light greenish grey, 404 calcareous,
grading downwards to calcilutite, 3654
calcareous, below 7835 feet.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds' is easily recognised | ithological iy
by the abrupt change to shales below. The-induction electric log exhibits
a downwards decrease in resistivity while the gamma-sonic shows an
increase in gamma radiation and an increase in interval transit time.

The gradational relationship of the lithology of the upper portion
of the 'Woodbine beds' to the overlying 'Hibernia beds' has already been
discussed. Also, the difficulties in nominating a stage within the
Paleocene for basal 'Hibernia beds' has been pointed out. Within the
Woodbine beds' Coleman initially assigned an Upper Cretaceous age to
core No.14 (6730|-6748!) based on thin section identifications. (He
had been unable to recover free specimens from digested samples).

The Sandstone and the Shale exhibit a dull

gold fluorescence with a strong bluish white
cut. Although the Sandstone does not exhibit
any f#luorescence it gives a light green solvent
#luorescence. Ncither types of fluorescence
effect the colour of the solvent.

The solvent with the carbonaceous remains was a

the carbonaceous material, not the fluorescing
material.

The fluorescent solvent was left to stand with

PAGSAKAAND AN PIGHAK:

6.

Beiford, however, was successful in obtaining free specimens and, as

a result, nominated an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman has since seen some

ot Belford's material and (verbal communication) concurs in a Paleocene

age assignment. Core No.15 (7252'-7267') has been assigned a Maestrichtlan
age by both workers whereas Core No.16 (7575'-7590') is regarded as
Maestrichtian by Coleman and as Santonian or Campanian by Belford. Sidewall
core from 7891 feet and cuttings between 7700 and 7950 feet were analysed
without firm results. Coleman, however, does suggest that the interval
represents the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous and possibly part of the
Lower Cretaceous as well. In the absence of firm palaeontological evidence
the writer would prefer to regard the 'Woodbine beds' as being Paleocene
through Upper Cretaceous with no Lower Cretaceous present.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds! coincides with a regional ly mappable
seismic disconformity. :

White the subdivision of the conformable and gradational sequence of
Eocene-Paleocene carbonates into two "formations", the 'Hibernia beds!
above and 'Woodbine beds' below, has been recommended on the basis of
the regional mappability of the boundary by seismic means, it is to be
emphasized that the succession is conformable and comprises several cycles
of carbonate sedimentation. i

Upper Jurassic
Unnamed sediments - (7956'-8102')

The interval 7956 feet to 8031 feet consists of dark grey to black
slightly to non-caicareous shale with very fine mica, minor pyrite and
glauconite, minor fossils, and with current bedding. The underlying
23 foet (8031'-8054!) consists of Iithic sandstone, groen to grey,
medlum grained, domInantly argil laceous with gralns of opaque volcanics
and rare quartz, fresh feldspar, fossillferous with a green highly glauconitic
matrix. The basal unit of this unnamed sedimentary sequence consists of
48 feet (8054'-8102') of light brown to greenish grey calcarenite
containing subangular to subrounded dark greenish grey volcanic fragments
and subangular hard calcite fragments in a cryptocrystal line matrix,

. slightly fossiliferous, rarely ferruginous.

Core No.17 (8016'-8023') from near the base of the shale Interval
yielded no useful macro or microfossils. However, Balme recovered spores
and pollen which are not chronologically significant but are suggestive
of a Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age. The microplankton similarly are
not accurately definitive but the genus Scrinrodinium is apparently typical
of the Upper Jurassic although a species occurs in the Lower Cretaceous of
Western Australia. On balance Balme considers "the assemblage is late
Jurassic although an early Cretaceous age is not out of the question".

Considering that this unnamed sedimentary sequence contains clastic
material derived from the underlying volcanic sequence and, considering also
the relative ages of these sediments and the underlying volcanics, it is
probable that these sequences are essentlatly conformable.

wWbj - 1141m
"Ashmore volcanic beds! - (8102'-9143")

The informally named 'Ashmore volcanic beds! may be subdivided into
two units:

8102'-8172' Altered amygdaloidal basalt, dark grey, with
phenocrysts of pyroxene and probably feldspar in

a matrix of iron oxides including haematite, and
altered feldspar. Irregular aggregates are a
mixture of green chlorite, calcite and a zeoite
and resemble amygdales.

PETROLOGY REPORTS



PETROLOGY AND PETROGRAPHY
OF

SELECTED ROCKS

FOR

ASHMORE REEF WELL No.1

BY

J.E. GLOVER



.

The rocks selected for discussion fall naturally into three groups.
Thes are

CO) the sedimentary rocks from 7950 - 8085 feet inclusive,
(2) #he volcanic rocks from 8106 - 8841.5 feet inclusive, and
B3) the sedimentary rocks from 9295 - 9316 feet Inclusive.

The petrographic descriptions of these rocks are followed by a brief
discussion of their petrology and speculation on some of the events
to their formation.

A report on Cores 25 and 26. as well as cuttings from the intervals
11830 - 11840! and 11930 - 11940! is also included. :

CUTTINGS 9750 - 7960 feet.

Handspecimen

The cuttings include light grey, dark grey and brown, very fine-
gralned rock fragments, and a few muscovite flakes.

Thin section

Gralns included in the thin section range from foraminiferal,
argi llaceous calcilutite to foramini feral, calcareous claystone.

SIDEWALL CORE 39, 7967 foot.

Handspecimen

The material in this specimen consists of friable, pale grey and grey-
green fragments in which it is difficult to distinguish any texture
with the hand lens.

Thin section

The fragments are made up of sedimentary rock particles. One particle
is a foraminiferal calcarenite containing a little silt-sized quartz,
rare brown fragments of possible collophane, and a sand grain of basalt.
Another particle consists of silty, glauconitic, foraminiferal,
calcareous claystone.

CUTTINGS 8020 - 8030 feet.

PAA AA an

Handspec imen

The specimen consists of cuttings of grey sedimentary rock.

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone in which most of the grains range between

0.12 - 0.50 mn., are angular to subangular and are opaque. The

opaque grains are either black or dark .grey to red-brown In reflected

doubt, the presence of some dark grains of undoubted basaltic origin
suggests a volcanic derivation for all of them. The clearly basaltic
.grains contain abundant, minute feldspar laths with intergranular

iron oxide grains and a little secondary chlorite. Other material in the

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone containing varied debris, including abundant
subangular to subrounded grains of volcanic rock. One volcanic

.grain is composed mainly of almost colourless glass containing a few
laths of feldspar and a little chlorite. Most grains are darker, and
many have an intergranular groundmass with opaque iron oxide filling
#he interstices between minute feldspar laths. Ferromagnesian
minerals, including phenocrysts, seem to have been present, but are
altered beyond recognition. Chlorite is a common secondary mineral
in the volcanic grains. Many of the grains are hemihyal ine and contain
minute laths of feldspar in grey, brown and dark brown glass. Brown
scoriaceous material, sometimes spoken of as thread-lace scoria or
reticulite, is particulariy common as angular to subangular fragments.
The vesicles in this scoria are generally filled with glauconite, which
is also common as discrete sandsized pellets. (Other sandsized grains
in the rock include labrodorite and andesine-fel dspar, quartz and very
rare analcite-nepheline fragments. The grains range mainly between
0.25 - 0.50 mm in diameter, and are cemented locally by calcite and
by an argil laceous matrix. Some of the opaque iron oxide of the
voicanic grains has a red-brown stain in reflected light, despite the
presence of glauconite, which forms in a neutral to somewhat 'reducing
environment.

Thread-lace scorla is one of the products of lava fountains in some
eruptions, but may also form as froth on the crusts of fluid gas-rich
pahoehoe lavas. in other words, i'ts presence in this rock sugg sts
tuffaceous activity, but is not conclusive. Other material, such as



quartz, argillaceous material, and probably the rounded volcanic grains,
are likely to be the products of normal processes of erosion,
transportation, sorting and deposition. Glauconite is an authigenic
mineral. Some of the contributing volcanic material was alkaline,

much of it was obviously basic.

The rock can best be described as a moderately well sorted, medium

sandstone containing abundant basaltic material.

Thin section

The rock Is porphyritic with highly altered phenocrysts up to one
millimetre long in a groundmass of opaque iron oxldes and
minute altered teldspar laths. The larger phenocrysts were feldspars
and have been converted to a mixture of calcite, green chlorite and a
colourless mineral, probably a zeolite. Some of the chlorite is
brownish, apparently due to iron staining, but there is another brown
to brownish-green mineral with slightly higher birefringence which may
be a clay mineral. No feldspar is sufficiently unaltered for precise
determination. Some of the smaller phenocrysts are shaped like olivine,
but are also completely altered, mainly to green chlorite but partly
'to a brown mineral. The opaque iron oxides of the groundmass include
Iimenite, leucoxene and some haematite.

Some minerals in the slide are unusually shaped, and have either filled
.vesicles or replaced the rock in irregular fashion. These minerals
consist of calcite and analcite, but there Is also a less common
flaring mineral of low birefringence and low relleft which may be a
zeolite. Many patches of these minerals have a rim of iron-stained

mineral, perhaps a clay mineral. :

Samples from core No.18 (8281'-8290!) were radiometrically dated by
the potasslum-argon method by Dr. lan McDougall of the Research School
of Physical Sciences, Department of Geophysics and Geochemistry at the
Australian National University, Canberra. He reports an age, based on
duplicate measurements, of 137.3 4 3 million years. The age obtained
can be regarded as a minimum value, owing to the deuteric alteration
in the rock some diffusive loss of radiogenic argon may have occurred
so that the true age may be a few percent older.

The presence of numerous tuffaceous interbeds attests to several
distinct volcanic flows. These individual flows may have been separated

"by several days or several million years. Accordingly, samples of core

No.19 from 8841.5 teet and 8842.5 feet were submitted to Dr. McDougall
in an attempt to determine if an appreclable portion of Jurassic time
is represented by the volcanic sequence. The two samples yielded
comparable dates at 129.4 4 3.0 million years which is regarded as

a reliable minimum age. “Tlaarly these samples have leaked more argon
than those from the higher core. This may be due to a greater degree
of alteration and/or to the greater depth and attendant higher temperatures
that core No.19 samples have experienced. Dr. McDougall concludes that
the volcanic sequence was erupted during one main volcanic episode of
relatively short duration (say several million years). The writer
concludes that it is unlikely that pre-Tithonian Jurassic beds are
present at Ashmore Reef, The 'Ashmore volcanic beds' are unconformably

This rock is mineralogically a Ilttle different from the specimens
of Core 18 in that 1t contains fewer phenocrysts of augite and

phenocrysts having the characteristic shape of olivine, in a ground
mass which ranges from intergranular, with aligned plagioclase laths,
and granules of purplish-brown pyroxene and black iron oxide, to the
less common intersertal texture, in which the plagioclase laths are
separated mainly by chlorite. Most of the phenocrysts lie between
0.1 - 0.6 mn. in length, and they are generally altered to a pale
.green rim of chlorite with a calcite core. Calcite and chlorite also
form veins in the rock, and a few irregulariy shaped masses of calcite
with chiorite rims resemble amygdales but their nature is uncertain.
There are also some green patches which resemble chlorite but seem to be
completely isotropic.

Phenocrysts of titaniferous augite and plagloclase are rare and small.
Most of the laths of plagioclase in the groundmass range from 0.1 -
0.2 mm. in length, and their composition is apparentiy mainly In the
andesine range. Colourless rods with oblique extinction are too small
for determination but seem to be augite.

This rock is a chloritized and carbonated ol ivine basalt in which all
olivine has been replaced, and it resembles rocks from 8839 feet and
88411 feet in Core 19 in having abundant altered olivine phenocrysts.
However, in the last two mentioned rocks the alteration products of the
olivine crystals are generally different. A few are changed to a green
chlorite, and some are partly changed to calcite, but most are changed to
green or yellow-green, fibrous to finely divided material with moderately
high birefringence. The slight, apparently gradational variations in
colour and texture of this material make it possible that either two
minerals, or one mineral with a range of. properties, are present.
Patches of a green mineral resembl ing chlorite but seemingly isotropic,
like volcanic glass, have also been observed in these rocks.

It is difficult, in view of the range of green and yellow green

minerals in this rock, to obtain a pure separation of one mineral. An

X-ray powder pattern photograph of green material separated from one of

#he rocks is somewhat blurred and not conclusive. The dominant pattern
resembles nontronite but does not correspond precisely with known

patterns of that mineral. To sum up, most of the olivine in the rocks

from 8839 feet and 88415 feet has altered to material that is clos

to nontronite in many of its properties, and some of the olivine has altered

to chlorite and calcite.

PETROLOGY
(1) SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BETWEEN 7950-8085 FEET

The specimens include cuttings and sidewall cores. There is a
diversity of sedimentary rock types, including very fine grained,
foraminiferal, calcareous and argillaceous sediments. Sand-sized
particles of volcanic origin tend to become more important with
Increaslng depth. Some of these grains may have had a tuffaceous
origin, but the appearance of most of the volcanic sand grains Is
consistent with their having been derived by erosion from
extrusive rocks like those encountered deeper in the section.

(2). VOLCANIC ROCKS BETWEEN 8106-8841.5 FEET

The materlal studiod includes four sidewall cores (core 34, 8106 feet, h
core 33, B109 feet, core 32, 8154 feet, and core 31, BI6O feet), one
specimen of cuttings (8160-8170 feet) and: six core specimens (core 18

8281 feet, 8286 feet, 8290 feet, core 19 8835 feet, 8839 feet, 8891.5 ft.)

The rocks in sidewall cores 34, 33, and 32 are altered analcite bearing h
rocks for which the tentative names of analcite basanite and analcite F
tephrite have been suggested. These rocks also contain some haematite,
suggestive of their having been affected by weathering.

Volcanic rocks in sidewall core 31 and cores 18 and 19 are fresher, and
their feldspar is better preserved, which greatly assists in their
classification. None of the rocks contains olivine, but the shape of
many of the altered phenocrysts. resembles olivine, and suggests that all
the volcanic rocks so far encountered can be assigned to the alkaline
olivine-basalt suite. Altered phenocrysts of the supposed olivin are
more common in core 19 than In rocks of core 18 above, but no reason

is advanced for this at this stage.

(3) SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BETWEEN 9295-9316 FEET

. These rocks consist mainly of quartz sandstones with intercalations of
dark claystones, and they are lithologically distinct from the sedimentary
rocks above the volcanic rocks. Most of the sandstones have undergone
some diagenetic silification, but no evidgnce of tuffaceous contribution
has been observed. Final assessment of the environment of deposition

of this sequence must awalt comprehensive and detailed evaluation of

their combined lithological, palaeontological and palynological
characteristics, but what is at present known of them is not inconsistent
with a deltaic origin.

SPECULATION

The succession lends itself to speculation which closer sampling and

more detailed work may well modify. It is not unreasonable at this stage,
however, to suppose that flows were extruded on a land surface underlain
by sediments of deltaic origin. At least three flows may be represented,
all derived from an alkaline olivine basalt magma. The upper or analcite-
bearing rocks of the volcanic section, 'the most highly differentiated
Focks, seem to have been partly oxidized by exposure. The area may have
sunk partly as a result of the adjustment that caused the extrusions in
the first place. Alternatively, the flows may have issued from faults
which were active during the subsidence. Early-formed sedimentary rocks
received extensive contributions due to the erosion of exposed volcanic
rocks and perhaps also because of the expulsion of tuffaceous material,
but these contributions lessened and eventually ceased with further
depression of the area.

The rock is very fine-grained to aphanitic, and is dark grey. It
is cut by veins of a white to pale brown, locally coarse-grained mineral.
Effervescence in cold dilute hydrochloric acid is rather patchy.

Thin section : " E ma

The rock is made up of two main components. One component ranges
from silty claystone to argi | laceous siltstone and contains abundant
pyrite and carbonaceous materlal. Most of the argil laceous material
1s brown and finely divided, but there are patches and veins of a weli-
crystallized mineral of the kaolinite group. This mineral Is described
separately below. The other main component of the rock is carbonate. A
little carbonate is present in the claystone and siltstone but most of
it is segregated in veins. Some of it develops as rhomb-shaped grains
which do not stain, or stain patchily to turquoise in acid solution of
alizarin red S and potassium ferricyanide. Other carbonate stains deep
blue, or locally, purple. Grains studied in oils show a wide range of
refractive indices, and W in some grains attains 1.71. The unstained
carbonate is dolomite, the turquoise carbonate is ferroan dolomite and
the remaining carbonate is calcite.

The patches and veins of the well crystallized mineral of the
kaolinite group are dark grey in handspecimen, where they easily escape
observation. Some of the veins have been partly replaced by carbonate.
The mineral is colourless, has pronounced cleavage, oblique extinction and
Is optfIcally positive with a moderately sized optic axlal angle. The
optics indicate that the mineral is dicklte, and an X-ray powder pattern
Is consistent with this view. Dickite is not normally a mineral of
sedimentary origin, but is generally hydrothermal. It can be reasonably
suggested that the veins of this mineral were caused by hydrothermal
activity connected with the volcanism responsible for the extrusive rocks
higher in the sequence. If so however, .the temperatures Involved wer
low, for high temperatures would have destroyed plant microfossi Is.

The wide range in composition of this rock prevents its being given
a simple name. |t ranges from silty claystone to argillaceous siltstone,
and contains irregularly shaped veins of carbonate which is coarsely
crystalline in places. .

Handspeci men

The rock is dark grey and very fine grained, and contains a little
pyrite. 1t is cut by irregulariy shaped white veins which range in thickness
from less than one millimetre to almost two centimetres. The grey matrix and
the veins effervesce moderately in cold dilute hydrochloric acid.

- Thin section

Much of the rock stains in acid solution of alizarin red 5 and
potassium ferricyanide. Many veins and fossil fragments stain blue to
purple and consist of ferroan calcite. Other carbonate areas do not stain
(dolomite) and some stain turquoise (ferroan dolomite or ankerite).
Additional constituents of the rock are silty quartz, finely divided brown
argil laceous material, and pyrite grains.

The fabric and composition of the rock vary from place to place. The
best simpl mame for that part of the core sectioned is fossiliferous, f
siity, argil laceous limestone. - "

Handspec imen

The rock is grey and very fine-grained and contains elongate masses up to 8 cm t
long of white, coarse-grained material. The straight margins of many of these
bodies give the rock a brecciated appearance in places. Thin white veins are

also present.

The grey parts of the rock effervesce in cold dilute hydrochloric acid, but
effervescence in the white masses is generally limited to their margins. When

immersed in an acid solution of alizarin red S and potassium ferricyanide, the

white masses stain blue, and the cores of the white masses are not affected.

Thin section

The thin section was also stained before microscopic examination. The fine-
gralned part of the rock (which stains pink) consists of calcltic | ImestTone
in which the original fabric has been blurred by reorganization. Pellets,
fragments of brachiopods, crinoids and ostracods can be distinguished in a
finely crystal line matrix which also contains narrow bands of dark,
apparently carbonaceous material and minute grains of pyrite. Some of the
fossils are partly altered to chalcedony, and minute euhedra of authigenic
quartz are scattered throughout. The rock is cut by thin veins of #erroan

catcite, which stain blue.
Part of the rock near the coarsely crystalline masses consists of dolomite

ferroan calcite (stained purple to blue) and a core of mineral that does not

stain.

Some of the unstained mineral from the handspecimen was crushed and examined
in oils. The mineral is biaxial and optically positive with 2V close to 50?
and dispersion vr. The birefringence is low, and the upper and lower
indices are close to 1.630 and 1.620 respectively. There are at least two
cleavages, and many fragments have straight extinction. The properties
listed fit celestite. Its position in the core of the calcite-celestite
bodies suggests that it filled cavities lined with calcite, and therefore

crystallized after the calcite.

The shale between 11,524 feet and 11,657 feet (133 feet) is
up to 504 calcareous and regarded as a normal epineritic marine
deposit. The clastics from 11,657-11,980 feet are again relatively
sparse in carbonate and are regarded as parallc.

Balme has variously described cores Nos.20-25 from this interval
as "probably Upper Triassic", "consistent with Upper Triassic" and
"not likely older than Middle Triassic". On balance he considers the
sequence, at least down to 10,583 feet, to be Upper Triassic. At
11,024 feet (core No.24) Coleman has identified Costatoria suggestive
of an Upper Triassic age.

Unnamed Upper Trlassic Carbonates - (11,980'-12,703')

This interval consists of cryptocrystal line |imestone with minor
interbeds of slightly calcareous fossiliferous shale. These | ithologles
are indicative of shallow quiet water marine environment. Above 12,148
feet the upwards appearance of 33 feet of non-calcareous siltstone,
interbeds of slightiy quartzose shale and the argillaceous and quartzose
nature of the limestone itself attest to the early influx of clastic
material to the previously low energy environment.

From core No.27 (12,423'-12,433') Coleman has identified a mol luscan
fauna similar to an Upper Triassic assembiage found in Indonesia. The
gradational nature of the upper and lower contacts attest to the conformity
of the sequence and suggest the continuance of an Upper Triassic age to

total depth.

Lower Unnamed Upper Triassic Clastics - (12,703'-12,843') (T.D.)

These beds are the oldest penetrated by Ashmore Reef No.1. Therefore
it cannot be stated whether the interbedded calcareous siltstone and
sandstone with cryptocrystalline limestone and slightly calcareous shale
represent a minor clastic influx into a quiet shallow water marine environ-
ment or the closing phase of a much more extensive older clastic sequence.

Table 1 shows the regional age relationships between the section
penetrated at Ashmore Reef and rock units in the Carnarvon Basin and on

Portugese Timor.

STRUCTURE

Through the interval of unnamed early Middle to late Lower Miocene
sediments between 1053 feet and 2635 feet the Schlumberger dipmeter
recorded dips ranging from 0? to 470, The average dip of the observations
is 13.7? whereas the median observation Is 122, The median azimuth of
dip (for 569 observations) Is 0799. From seismic it is now recogni sed
that the underlying early Lower Miocene through Palaeocene rock sequence
is regionally thick and therefore Ashmore Reef was situated in a regional
low during these stages. It is interpreted that the upl 1ft required to
form the present day Ashmore Reef seismic structure began during the late
Lower-early Middle Miocene and the relatively high observed dips are due,
at least in.part to primary sedimentary dip on syntectonic clastic beds.
It Is possible, however, that in these semi-consol idated sediments, the
dipmeter is recording spurlous data and the higher magnitude dips are not

present.

PALAEONTOLOGICAL REPORT ON SAMPLES FROM

ASHMORE REEF NO.1 WELL

|NTRODUCT ION:

This report is a summary of palaeontological results obtained from
samples yielded by Ashmore Reef No.| Well, located on the edge of the
continental shelf, northwestern Australia. The samples came mostly
from cores, numbered 1 tto 27, supplemented by 21 sidewall samples and
33 ditch cuttings.

By and large, the succession revealed by these samples is a relatively
complete one, ranging from Quaternary to Upper Triassic, the Jurassic
alone being absent, palaeontologically. Importantly, the lower Tertiary
appears to be complete and in general, Ashmore Reef No.1 Wall offers
what may prove to be a standard stratigraphic column for this most
important and hitherto unknown region.

THE, SUCCESS1|ON:

1. 360 to 1000 feet - Cuttings samples.

There is a restricted but prolific fauna in this organic sediment, from
360 to approximately 550 feet, consisting of an abundance of individuals
of Operculina venosa (Fichtel and Moll), with rarer Cycloclypeus carpenteri
Brady, Baculogypsina sphaerulata (Parker and Jones) and other sti li-living
benthonic foraminitera. Bryozoan, algae and echinoid remains are present
in quantity. :

From 600 to 1000 feet there aro only scattered foraminifera In a dolomitised
biomicrite. The foraminifera are altered but the same genera and species
appear to be present. It is possible, nevertheless, that the deeper part
of this interval is of Pliocene age, but there is no worthwhile Pl iocene
section. The environment of deposition would seem to be as it is now, an
atoll, although the intense dolomitisation poses a problem in this environ-
ment, to which there is no sure answer as yet.

2. 1125 to 2928 feet - Cores 1 through 4 plus selected sidewall samples
and cuttings.

The faunas yielded by these cores range in age from late Lower Miocene (the
youngest) to early Lower Miocene. To 2300 feet, approximately, the fauna
includes Lepidocyc! ina WTrybliolepedina") radiata (Martin) Lepidocycl ina
CTrybliolepidina") sp cf. L. epigona Schubert, L. ("Nephrolepidina")
verrucosa scheffen, Miogypsina polymorpha (Rutten), Miogypsina sp., Gypsina

globula (Reuss), Sporadotrema spp. and Operculina complanata (Defrance).
This is a Miocene assemblage, probably late Lower Miocene but possibly early

Middie Miocene. The sediment is still a well-washed foramini feral calcarenite.
Below 2300 feet L. sumatrensis (Brady) and Miogypsina cushmani indonesiensis
Tan, become dominant, with a species of Cycloclypeus similar to C. indopacificus

Tan. Algae fragments are now common. AT 2,600 feet, the large Eulepidina

badjirraensis Crespin appears and at 2900 feet is the most dominant constituent

in the sediment, although Cycloclypeus is common, together with Heterostegina
borneensis van der Vierk, indicating a depth of accumulation exceeding 100 m,

This lowest assemblage is early Miocene in age, that is, approximately
Aquitanian or Tertiary upper "e". There is no change until about 3050 feet.

3. 3050 to 4000 feet - Sidewall samples plus Core 7.

A change in lithology is marked by the presence of more silt and clay, abundant
fine quartz and both benthonic and planktonic foraminifera. Large foraminifera
are absent. There is a restricted fauna of planktonics, with species in common

with warm-water Oligocene Pacific faunas (Todd, 1966). Species present ”



-2-

include Globigerina sellii (Borsetti) and G. tripartita tapuriensis
Banner and Blow.

There are also patchy occurrences of ostracodes which, in this type of
sediment, suggest a shallow water environment. The ostracode genera

include Trachyleberidea, Cl ithrocytheridea and ?Alatocythere which on

past experience are not found in sediments younger than Oligocene. In

Core 7 there is an unusual occurrence - a normal-sized fauna together

with a replicate fauna of so-called "dwarfs", which suggests an especially
favourable living environment. This part of the well is of special academic
interest, because it may weli offer a complete grading without hiatus from
the Upper Eocene (see below) and similarly, passing into the early Miocene,
above 3030 feet. "

4, 4000 to 4700 feet - Cores 8, 9 and sidewall sample.

Most of this interval is Upper Eocene, both Core 8 and 9 containing species

ot Discocylina and Aktinocyclina with Asterocycl ina mantanzensis Cole
especially common. Both small benthonic and planktonic foraminifera are

well represented. There is some glauconite and scatterings of dolomite
crystals. As has been the case throughout this succession so far, there
is little terrigenous sediment. The evidence continues to favour as an
environment of deposition, the notion of an off-shore crown or bank with
free access to open-ocean waters.

4. 4700 to 6020 feet - Cores 10 and 11, sidewall samples and cuttings.

The faunal content drops rapidly although there is still abundant organic
calcite, most of it in the form of macerated tesis - in general terms the
sediment is a dolomitised foraminiferal calcilutite. The few benthonic

and planktonic foraminifera could not be extracted for identification. The
log position and apparent absence of an hiatus suggests a Middle Eocene
through Upper Paleocene age for this interval.

5. 6020 to 6700 feet - Cores 12 and 13, sidewall samples.

Planktonic foraminifera are more common and include several species of

early Globorotalia. Positive specific identification was not possible

but G. sp. cf. G. aequa Cushman and Renz and G. sp. cf. G. acutispira Bolli
are very tentatively identified in Core 12, a sidewall sample at 6196, and
G. sp. cf. uncinata Boilli in Core 13. It may well be that this is a Middle-
Lower Paleocene section.

6. 6730 to 6748 feet - Core 14.

Globotruncana appears in this core, marking the uppermost Cretaceous - the
species is not identified positively but is referred to G. citae Bolli:

G. sp. cf. G. lugeoni. Tilev may also be present. Both these referals,

it shouid be noted, are based on thin-section study. Core 14 was dis-
aggregated only with difficulty and no diagnostic species could be identified.

TI. 7000 to 7690 feet - Cores 15 and 16, sidewall samples.

Over this interval the sediment is a pelagic o0ze with carbonaceous material
and a little marine manganese and pyrite. The fauna is a Globotruncana-rich
Senonian (Maestrichtian) one, dominated by G. tricarinata, that is, G.
lapparenti (or Iinneiana) tricarinata (Quereau), and including G. conica
Cushman.

8. 7700 to 7950 feet - Sidewall samples and cuttings.

Over this interval Globotruncana is replaced by a sparse fauna of small
globiqerinaceans in a calcilutite matrix which may also contain shell
fragments, e.g. at 7795 feet. Hedbergella is identified tentatively between
7850 and 7950 feet. No firm age can be assigned 'to this interval but it is
likely that at least the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous is present and
possibly part of the Lower Cretaceous as well.



9. 7960 to 8220 feet - Core 17 and sidewall samples and cuttings.

This interval is marked by a sudden increase in quartz, the appearance of
repeated bands of coarse shell fragments (echinoderms, molluscs, bryozoans)
and, below approximately 8090 feet, stained and probably weathered lava”
fragments.

10. 8281 to 9143 feet - Cores 18 and 19.

The basalt yielded by these cores is part of a volcanic sequence with
unusual petrological features (Company report by JE. Glover).

Uu. 9143 to 11000 feet - Cores 20, 21, 22 and 23, sidewall samples and
cuttings.

The sediment over this interval is primarily a micaceous, carbonaceous,
quartz arenite, usually fine grained but with many coarse and also silty
layers, extensively reworked and with greatly varying amounts of calcite.
There are no determinable fossils, although occasional scattered fragments
of pelecypods, echinderm plates, foraminifera and ostracodes show that much
of this interval is marine. ln general, the evidence suggests a deltaic
environment despite the lack of foresets and other positive delta criteria.

12. 11000 to 12000 feet - Cores 24, 25 and 25.

With Core 24, at 11024 feet, there is no great change in lithology but

C-pelecypod fragments become especially common. They include some identified

as the genus Costatoria suggestive of Upper Triassic age. The sediment is
extensively cleaved and fractured and over the remainder of the interval is
only poorly fossil iferous.

K

13. 12000 to 12843 feet (completion - Cores 26 and 27, sidewall samples
below 12433 feet.

Although quartz is still prominent in the sediment, calcite is the predominant
mineral, most of it in the matrix, for fossils are still quite rare and
confined to thin bands. The recognizable fauna is mol luscan although ostra-
codes are common but not extractable. In Core 27 the dominant sediment is

a calcarenite with microcoquinoidal bands and with scattered whole fossils.
The organic content may be up to 804. The fossils identified include Misolia
sp., Nucula sp. cf. N. misolensis Jaworski and ? Myophoria sp. These and
similar species occur in Indonesia (Krumbeck 1913, 1925, 1924) and suggest

an Upper Triassic age for the containing sediment. The same sediment occurs
in sidewall samples to 12843 feet, the completion depth of the well. Quartz
is stili a significant part of the sediment but the last 850 feet suggest
#hat Ashmore Reef Well No.! entered more nearly normal shallow water sediments,
marginally if at all deltaic and still of Upper Triassic age.

SUMMARY:

In brief the succession given suggests a history for the area which may be
outl ined as follows:-

Upper. Triassic

Near shore shallow water shelf conditions gradually built over by encroaching
delta. :

Jurassic

Hiatus, brought about by sedimentat ion being suspended or some part of erosion
of accumulated Jurassic sediment. Former alternative favoured. Submarine (?)

outpouring of lavals).



i
i
!
H

n4-

Uppermost Jurassic/early Cretaceous

Persisting shallow water conditions with influx of lava-derived terrigenous
material.

"Cretaceous

Downfaulting to depth. Accumulation begins (late Lower Cretaceous?) of
pelagic o0zes in considerable (251000 m.) depth of water. Subsidence
considered to be reglonal because of relative absence of terrigenous
material.

Pa leocene-Eocene

Build-up of lutitic sediments in shallowing water, until extensive
accumulation of Upper Eocene foraminiferal arenites. Inception of Ashmore

as a reef complex. N
Miocene

Palaeogene conditions persist into the Lower Middle Miocene. There is then
an apparent gap which is encountered also in other Indo-Pacitfic areas: a
problem not yet adequately recognised.

Quaternary

Development of Ashmore Reef into its modern form.

MICROFLORAL LISTS
Core 4: 2901-2928 fi.

Dicotyledonous pollen grains, possibly assignable to the Casuarinaceae,
occurred sparingly and a single specimen of a podocarpaceous conifer pollen
grain was identified.

Dinoflagel lates were fairly common, but the suite was poorly diversified
and consisted of about four species of spinose forms belonging to the genera
Hystrichosphaera and Achomosphaera. None of these is known to have a closely
restricted range elsewhere, and the most that can be inferred from the
palynological evidence is that the sample is Upper Cretaceous or Tertiary.

gram of sediment, based on counts of representative samples gave the
following results:

Spores 13/gm
Angiosperm pollen 343/gm
Dinof lagel lates 1286/gm
Fungi 502/gm
Acritarchs 3940/gm
Gymnosperm pol len 13/gm.

Age: The core is dated as Oligocene from foraminiferal evidence
and the palynological data are consistent with this estimate, although
in themselves not chronologically critical. In southern Australia
. Nothofagacidites appears to be most common in late Eocene to early Miocene
sediments although its complete known range is late Cretaceous to Recent.
All the other spore and pollen species range throughout the Cainozoic in
Australia, with the exception of the form recorded as aff. Chenopodium sp.
This is represented by only two specimens, however, and the possibility
“that these are modern contaminants cannot be excluded.

Although pollen grains are 5parse in the slides, their frequency is
fairly high for this type of sediment. Concentrations of over 300/gm
suggest that the sediment was laid down fairly close to land. It is
perhaps noteworthy, however, that all the angiosperm pollen species are
small forms which are likely to have been widely distributed by currents.
Not much published data exists on the distribution of dinoflagellates in
modern marine sediments, but investigations in the Gulf of Mexico (Traverse
and Ginsburg 1966) indicate that they are most abundant in shallow, some-
what off-shore, marine environments.

Core 8: 4036-4063 feet
The total yield of plant microfossils from this sample was lower than
that from Core 4 or Core 7. This is likely to be controlled by the lithology

of the sediment rather than any notable change in environment of deposition.

Comments:

The assemblage is too poorly diversitied to enable the sediment
to be dated more precisely than late Cretaceous or Tertiary. It differs
in no obvious fundamental way from that occurring in Core 7, allowing
for the greater diversity of angiosperm pollen grains in the higher core.

Core 15: 7252-7267 fi.

Although its content of acid-insoluble microfossils was low, the
sample yielded a fairly diverse suite of dinoflagel lates and acritarchs,
much more so than any of the assemblages from cores higher in the well.

Fungal teleutospores occurred occasional ly.

Age: Although many of the forms recorded resemble species previously
identified from Europe and Australia, it is not easy to assess their
stratigraphic significance except within broad limits. Odontochitina
operculata is a distinctive species which is common in the Cenomanian in
Australia, although its complete range is probably Neocomian to late
Cretaceous.

Many of the species of Hystrichosphaeridium and Hystrichosphaera
resemble forms from the European Senonian and there is no doubt that, as a

whole, the assemblage has a distinct!y Upper Cretaceous aspect. However,
documentation of the stratigraphic ranges of dinoflagellate species is
still at a rudimentary stage and it would be premature to base firm bio-
stratigraphic conclusions on a single assemblage from a geographical ly
isolated area.

Environment of deposition

Marine with little evidence of terrestrially derived organic material.
Quartz grains of presumably clastic origin are, however, fairly plentiful in
the residue.

Scriniodinium sp. cf. S. attadalense Cookson 4 Eisenack



Age: This assemblage is quite different in the abundance of plant
microfossils from any recovered from cores higher in the well. Its
composition is also unusual and distinct from the assemblage listed from
Core 15.

The spore and pollen species are of no critical chronological
signiticance, although the presence of Classopollis torosus suggests a
Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age.

The microplankton recorded resembled forms known to be widely
distributed in late Jurassic and early Cretaceous sediments in Australia
and elsewhere. 1t lacks, however, the species which have been used in
Australia as a "zonal" indices for that part of the geological column.

A possible exception is Scriniodinium cf. attadalense, a Neocomian-early
Aptian form in Australia. Forms normally associated with S. attadalense
(e.g. Dingodinium cerviculum) were not found in the present assemblage

and this fact, together with the slight doubt concerning its identification,

makes one cautious about proposing a firm age.

| favour a Lower Cretaceous (Neocomian) age, but cannot exclude
the possibility that the sample is late Jurassic i.e. "Tithonian" in the
rather loose sense in which this Stage name has been used by Australian
microplankton workers.

Environment of deposition: Marine with a low content of terrestrially
derived microfossils.

Core 20: 9295-9317 ft.

Acritarchs:

Large fragments of cuticle were abundant and some of these showed
c Il outlines of the Dicroidium type. :

Age: Th assemblage is of Triassic age and its gross composition
compares closely with those encountered in Upper Triassic d posits in
Tasmanla, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In common
with many Australian Triassic assemblages, this one is not very diverse



and is dominated by pollen grains of the falcisporites type. These almost
certainly derive from corystosperms, a group of Triassic plants which bore
leaves referred to Dicroidium (z- Thinnfeldia of some workers).

Upper Triassic strata are not known from surface exposures in Western
Australia although they probably occur in bores at Onslow and Long Island in
the Carnarvon Basin. The associated volcanics in Ashmore Reef may be contem-
poraneous with intrusives encountered in Barlee No.1 well in the Canning
Basin, although there is a substantial discrepancy in the radiometric ages
attributed to the two suites.

Environment of deposition:

Acritarchs occurring in the siltier lithologies in Core 20 suggest
. marine influences, although the bulk of the microfossils and the organic
-debris are of terrestrial origin. This suggests.a paralic succession with
alternating near-shore/marine and non-marine deposits.

Age: From the abundance of Falcisporites australis the assemblage is

undoubtediy Triassic. It is not diverse enough to enable a more precise
dating although it is not likely to be older than Middle Triassic.

Environment of deposition: The relative abundance of coarse plant tissues,

together with the gross lithology of the core sample, suggest a shal low
water environment not far removed from the site of plant growth.

listed above all occur in Upper Triassic sediments in Queensland and South
Australia (de Jersey 1962, Playtord 4 Dettmann 1965). In its quantitative
composition the assemblage from Core 21 resembles those from the Ipswich
Coal Measures. 1t has less in common with those from the Mungaroo Beds
in the Carnarvon Basin. These are also probably of Upper Triassic age,
but contain species known trom the late Triassic of Madagascar, which
have not so far been found in eastern Australia.

Environment of deposition: All the plant microfossils identified appear to -
derive from vascular plants and the assemblage contains no obviously marine
elements. |t is consistent with a non-marine origin and the sediment is
probably a deltaic swamp accumulation.

Age: The assemblage is dominated by Falcisporites australis, a form
which appears to range throughout the Triassic in Australia, but is most
abundant in Middle and Upper Triassic deposits. All the other elements in
the assemblage are consistent with an Upper Triassic age, and the association
of Annulispora folliculosa, Guthoerl isporites cancellosus, Duplexisporites
gyratus, and Platysaccus gueenslandi, suggests a correlation with part of the
Leigh Creek Coal Measures in South Australia, the Ipswich Coal Measures in
Queensland and perhaps the Brady Formation in central Tasmania (see de
Jersey 1962, Playford and Dettmann 1965, Playford 1965).

Environment of deposition: Probably non-marine, reducing, environment from
the abundance of well-preserved vascular plant fragments and the absence of

spinose acritarchs.

Core 24: 11,033 ft.

An unusual! apparently undescribed acritarch also occurred fairly
commonly. This has a spheroidal test about 4Qu in diameter, its surface
divided into rounded polygonal fields (about 5u in diameter) by rows of
closely packed fine spines. The form is distinctive and does not fit
easily into any existing form genus of the Acritarcha. |

Age: Apart from its content of acritarchs, the assemblage does
not differ essentially from that listed from Core 23. |t is also Triassic
and probably Upper Triassic in age.
Environment of deposition: The presence of spinose acritarchs suggests
marine influences and the sediment may represent a marine incursion across

low-Iying delta swamps. Fragments of land plants are nevertheless dominant
in the assemblage.

Alisporites sp. cf. A. opii Daugherty

Age: The assemblage differs slightly trom those recorded from the
higher Triassic cores, particularly in its fairly high content of the costate
pollen grain Ephedripites. This form genus has a long geological range
and, although it is common in Upper Triassic sediments elsewhere in the
world, no precise stratigraphic significance can be attributed to the species
r presented here. The assemblage is not older than Middle Triassic and the
evidence favours an Upper Triassic age.

Environment of deposition: No evidence of marine organisms and assemblage
similar to those from Triassic sediments higher in the well, for whicha

deltaic swamp origin was suggested.

Cuttings: 12,050-12,060 ft.

SUMMARY

Plant microfossils were recovered from sixteen samples from Ashmore
Reef No.1 Well. The assemblages described fall into one of four broad
categories:

|. Cores 4, 7 and 8 yielded sparse assemblages, mainly of dino-
flag llates, but containing occasional spores and dicotyledonous pollen
grains. They are not diverse enough to attempt close dating, but are
consistent with a Tertiary ag . I



-I12-

2. Core 15 (7252-67 ft.) contained fairly diverse microplankton and
very rare spores and pollen. |t is assigned to the Upper Cretaceous.

3. Core 17 (8016-23 ft.) was the highest sample to yield abundant
acid-insoluble microfossils. These were mainly acritarchs and dino-
flagellates. The association is rather unusual but sugges?s an upper-
most Jurassic or early Cretaceous age.

4. Samples between 9295 ft. and 12,830 ft. contain essentially .
similar assemblages. There is evidence for a minor 'break' between
10,583 ft. and 11,033 ft. and the lower samples show evidence of marine
influences during deposition. All the assemblages are of Triassic age
and those between 9295 ft. and 10,583 ft. are considered to be Upper
Triassic. Below the latter depth the assemblages are insufficiently
diverse and too poorly preserved to enable any attempt at refined dating,
but there Is nothing which suggests that they are older than Middle
Triassic and the whole sequence could be Upper Triassic.

Plant tissues were abundant in all the Triassic samples, and it
is likely that they were laid down' in an environment not far removed
from the site of plant growth. Considering the palynological evidence,
and the gross IIthology of the succession, a deltaic coastal plain appears

Although plant microfossils were not usually well preserved below
about 9000 feet, they were still identitiable at 12,830 ft, From this
it is concluded that the sediments have not been subjected to tectonism
or affected by igneous activity.

NOTE ON FORAMINIPERA FROM ASHMORE No. 1 WELL:  CORES 1 TO 16 INCLUSIVE

CORE 7: Abundant well-preserved planktonic foraminifera, including:

Globoguadrina sp. cf. G. dehiscens praedehiscens Blow and Banner

A significant feature of this fauna is the presence of specimens
referable to Globigerinoides quadrilobatus primordius Blow and Banner. This
form developed from Globigering pxaebulloides occlusa in the middle part of
the Globorotalia kugleri zone of the Trinidad sequence, by the addition of a
single dorsal supplementary aperture, and is stated to be an index form for this
zone (Blow and Banner 1962) . The other species recorded are longer ranging, but
the fauna is considered to be referable to the Globorotalia kugleri zone.

Recent investigations suggest that this zone is at the Oligocene-Aquitanian
boundary,
CORE 8:  Larger foraminifera and rare poorly preserved planktonic
foraminifera,

Discocyelina (s.1.) spp.

@loboxotalia sp.cf.G.centralis Cushman and Bermudez
CORE 9:  Larger foraminifera.

Discocyclina (s.1.) spp

Cores 8 and 9 are regarded as Upper Eocene in age.

CORES 10 and 11: No identifiable foraminifera have been obtained,from,or observed in,
these cores. Their position in the sequence suggests a lower to middle Bocene

age.

CORE 12: No identifiable free specimens of foraminifera have been obtained.
Examination of polished surfaces of the core shows species of Globigerina and
Globorotalia of a type thought to be basal Eocene in age, although they may be

uppermost Paleocene,

Attention: Mr R.W, Craig
Senior Geologist

Dear Sir,

K-Ar Dating of Core 19, 8835-8844 feet, Ashmore Reef No.1

From the two pieces of core 19 supplied,thin sections were
cut for preliminary examination as to the suitability of the
rocks for dating. In both basalts microphenocrysts of
completely altered olivine (O. 3-1 mm in size) and rare clino-
pyroxene phenocrysts occur in a fine grained groundmass (0.02-
0.2 mm) consisting of fresh clinopyroxene prisms, iron oxide,
plagioclase laths (sometimes altered), and a considerable amount
of nearly isotropic, pobrly crystallized material. In addition
chlorite is present in the groundmass and as veins through the -
rocks. In the sample from 88413 feet the amount of plagioclase
is small, whereas in 88423 feet plagioclase is abundant and is
aligned to give the rock a fluidal texture. These basalts show
considerable evidence of alteration, which, however, maybe
mainly deuteric. The rocks are similar to that in core 18,
examined previously, the degree of alteration being comparable.

Because of the fine grain size of the alteration products,
together with the higher temperatures at depths of the order of
9000 feet, it was realized that some leakage of radiogenic argon
may have occurred since the basalts crystallized. Nevertheless
both samples were processed and the results are given in the
enclosed table. The indicated ages agree to within experimental
error, at 129.4 t 3.0 m.y. This is a reliable minimum age, and
the results show that both samples have retained radiogenic argon
equally well. However, the dates are significantly younger
than that obtained on basalt from core 18, 600 feet higher in
the well. Clearly there has been greater leakage of radiogenic
argon from the core 19 samples than from the core 18 basalt.
This may be due to different degrees of alteration, and/or to
the greater depth and hence higher temperatures that the core 19
basalts have experienced. The amount of loss of radiogenic
argon is impossible to estimate. Because of the petrographic
similarity between the basalts from cores 18 and 19, together
with the comparable (if reversed) dates, my personal
interpretation is that the basalts were erupted during one main
volcanic episode, possibly of relatively short duration (say
several million years).

Because of the demonstration that some leakage of radiogenic
argon has occurred from the basalts these data unfortunately do
not allow an unequivocal interpretation. as to how much of the
Jurassic is represented at Ashmore Reef, My opinion is that
there may be an appreciable period of time not represented by
deposition or volcanism.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr Martison,

Further to our Phone conversation today I enclose
details of the potassium-argon age results on the basalt core
at 82811-8290! in the Ashmore Reef No.l well.

The thin section we cut of the basalt showed it to
contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and altered olivine ina
fluidal groundmass consisting of plagioclase laths, small
prisms of clinopyroxene, iron oxide, and a distinct poorly
crystallized, low birefringent feldspathic (7) phase together
with considerable chloritic material. The rock is reasonably
fresh and what alteration is present is probably deuteric.

The details of the K-Ar measurements are given in the
attached table. Both K and Ar were measured in duplicate with
most satisfactory reproducibility. The probable error for the
final calculated age is about #2.5 per cent. The age obtained,
137.3 4 3 m.y., can be regarded as a reliable minimum estimate
for the time of crystallization. Owing to the deuteric
alteration in the rock some diffusive loss of radiogenic argon
may have occurred, so that the true age may be a few per cent
older.

On the presently accepted physical time scale (cf. Quart.
Jour. Geol. Soc. London, v.120 S, special volume, p.260) the
indicated age is equivalent to the top of the Jurassic, as the
Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary is estimated to lie at an age of
about 136 m.y. Such an age is reasonably consistent with the
palaeontological determination obtained:5ediments 260! higher

.up the core, and clearly indicates that the basalts are in

conformable sequence with the overlying sediments.

Yours sincerely,
Paa N

The early Lower Miocene interval of 2635 feet to 3062 feet
exhibits a dipmeter baseline of dip of 20-30 with downwards decreasing
or increasing dip patterns up to a maximum dip of 202. The true
structural dip is interpreted as 22-3? to the ENE. Downwards
increasing dip patterns may be indicative of minor normal faults at
2662 feet, 2735 feet and 2756 feet.

Other dip patterns are interpreted as due to primary sedimentary
dip.

Similarly, the Ol igocene maris from 3062 feet to 4009 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip of between 0? and 22. Numerous
downwards increasing or decreasing patterns of greater dip are most
likely due to differential compaction of these plastic sediments.
Small normal faults, also attrIbutable to this cause, also may be
present.

The Eocene-Palaeocene carbonates of the interval 4009-6543 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip which increases downwards from 2?
to 50. Numerous increasing or decreasing downwards patterns of dip
are interpreted as indicative of primary sedimentary dip, although
minor normal faults may result in some of the increasing downwards
patterns. Rose diagram plots of dip azimuths suggest dip to 2790 in
the upper part. of the sequence, changing to 319? towards the base.

The Cretaceous sequence of maris and limestones from 6543 feet
to 7956 feet exhibits a pronounced dipmeter baseline of dip of 9?
down ko 6740 feet and of 12-2? from there to the base. As before,
the numerous greater dips observed fall into patterns Interpreted as

.due to primary sedimentary dip. One possible exception Is the pattern

ot increasing dips (to 90) which terminates abruptly at 7226 feet,
this could indicate a minor normal fault at that depth. Median
azimuth of baseline dips is 143?,

The thin sequence of uppermost Jurassic sediments which unconformably

underile the Upper Cretaceous sequence in the interval 7956 feet to

8102 feet exhibit a baseline of dip of 12-22 on the dipmeter. Patterns

of greater dip (up to 100) are attributed to primary sedimentary dip.
Median dip azimuth is 93?. The 'Ashmore volcanic beds' between 8102

feet and 9143 feet, as would be expected, exhibit a somewhat variable
baseline of dip of from 12 to 67. Numerous greater dips are interpreted

as due to irregular lava flow contacts. Median azimuth of dip is to the

sw.

The unnamed Upper Triassic clastic sequence from 9143 feet to
11,980 feet exhibits a baseline of dip between 3 and 10? with extremely
numerous patterns of greater dip (up to 240) indicative of primary
sedimentary dip. Median azimuth of both the baseline of dip and of
#he sedimentary dip patterns is southeast. The Upper Triassic carbonates
between 11,980 feet and 12,703 feet have a baseline of dip at 12 to #?.
Median azimuth of these dip observations is 2450, Numerous patterns of
greater dip are interpreted as due to primary dip, these have a median
azimuth of 140?. The deepest Upper Triassic beds drilled between 12,703
feet and 12,843 feet exhibit a baseline of dip between 12 and 5? with a
median dip azimuth of 520, Greater dips are interpreted of sedimentary
origin, median azimuth of these Is 1130,

the Stratigraphic Nomenclature Committee of the Geological Society
of Australia and in consideration of the following factors which
suggest the desirability and the validity of considering these units
as formational divisions:
a) The Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous sequence is the most
palaeontologically complete known to date in the Indo-Pacific region
. and therefore significant as a type section.
b) The chosen unit boundaries coincide with seismic reflections
which are mappable over a wide area of the Sahul Shelf. Less tangible
is the high degree of seismic record character continuity over intervals
representative of the units proposed.
While the terminology has been discussed with the appropriate
authorities the following names are considered as unpublished and
therefore have no standing, these should not be used in a publication
without definition and the approval of the Divisional Stratigraphic
Nomenclature Subcommittee. i

The dipmeter results agree with the observations of dip in
recovered cores (see Table of Observed Dips). The low magnitude of
dips and varlability of dip azimuth throughout the Lower Miocene to
Upper Cretaceous rock units suggests that the well was located very
near the apex of the Ashmore Reef anticline. Jurassic beds have a
slightly steeper structural dip (8 62) as do those of the Upper
Triassic clastics (2107), respective southwesterly and southeasterly
median azimuths of dip apply. ' 1t therefore could be argued that the
well is consierably downdip in a southerly direction from the
structural apex in rocks of these ages. However, due to the presence
of the major down-to-the-north, northeasterly trending normal fauit
located approximately 1 mile north of the well, it is unlikely that
a significant area of higher structural elevation is present.

before and after drilling. |

RELEVANCE TO OCCURRENCE OF PETROLEUM

Hydrocarbon Shows

No signs of liquid hydrocarbon were observed in the Ashmore Reef
No.1 well.

The only indications of gas from the mud analyser were of a very
minor nature and occurred while drilling the Upper Jurassic 'Ashmore

@mamapa maa

volcanic beds', especially from the upper interval of altered amygdalol dal
basalt. Between 8152 feet and 8174 feet percentages of 1.35 methane and
0.0468 ethane were recorded. Intermittent shows of methane up to 0.475
persisted to a depth of 8885 feet. Thereafter trip gas containing up to
18 methane and nitrogen was observed during drilling to total depth. The
magnitude of these gas indications was insufficient to warrant testing
which was not recommended.

Porosity and Permeabi li ty

intervals of good porosity and permeability were encountered in the
Quaternary, early Middle to late Lower Miocene, early Lower Miocene,
Eocene-Paleocene, and Upper Triassic rock sequences.

Porosity logs were not run on the Quaternary foraminiferal |Imeston
“ and calcarenite above 978 feet. However, these posed continuing lost
circulation problems during drilling and are presumably highly porous
and permeable. Between 978 and 1053 feet these beds have log-indicated
porosities of 31-325.

The early Middle to late Lower Miocene log porosities between 1053
| and 2635 feet vary from 22 to 355 (see log interpretation for greater
detail). Core No.2 from 2286 feet to 2310 feet revealed similar
porosities of 21 to 358 with permeabilities of between 15 and 1134
millidarcies. Core No.3 of the interval 2619 to 2644 feet analysed
between 19 and 245 porosity and 0.96 to 5.44 millidarcies.

The Eocene calcarenites of the 'Hibernia beds' in the interval
“4009 to 4484 feet exhibit sonic log porosities of between 20-275
porosity and average 238. Core No.8 of the interval 4036-4063 feet
analysed to 18-304 porosity with 19.7 to 312 millidarcies permeability.

Sandstones in the Upper Triassic mixed clastic sequence in the
interval 9143 to 11,980 feet have porosities varylng between 20 and
94 as revealed by log analysis. In a general way, sandstones near
the top of the interval tend to be more porous and permeable than
those below. The following ranges of porosities and permeabi llties
were recorded from sandstone beds in cores:

Core Interval Porosity Range Permeabi lity Range

25 11,716'1-11,724! nil - not analysed

Igneous Activity

The occurrence of Upper Jurassic volcanics in the interval 8102
feet to 9143 feet is only detrimental to petroleum prospects in this
and older age sediments insofar that associated volcanic necks and
presumably present assoclated dykes and sills may have broken up any
pre-existing oil migration pattern. Although the corresponding seismic
interval of high energy dies out rapidly at Ashmore Reef, this does not
preclude the reglonal presence of additional volcanic sequences in the
Sahul Shelf area.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

Virtuaily every aspect of geologic Information from as remote a
stratigraphlc test as Ashmore Reef No,| is of importance. The most
significant contributions to geological knowledge are:

(a) The thick (5321 foot) interval of Lower Miocene through
Upper Cretaceous sequence of terrigenous-poor sediment
is palaeontological ly paraconformable and regarded by
palaeontologists as possibly the most complete in a time-
rock sense yet revealed in the Indo-Pacific region.
Nevertheless, sharp lithological boundaries and possible
faunal gaps tend to support the selsmic record sectlon
evidence of unconformable/disconformable relationships
of the Oligocene 'Cartier beds' marls to the underlying
Eocene-Paleocene 'Hibernia beds!'. Furthermore, the
seismic interval isochron map of the Tertiary portion
of this 'paraconformable' sequence suggests Ashmore Reef
to be in a depositional synclinal position, during
those times, within the general Sahul Shelf area.

(b) The uplift which produced the Ashmore Reef anticlinal
structure was post-early Middle Miocene In age.

(c) The apparent absence of Lower Cretaceous sediments or
appreciable Jurassic sediments sets the Ashmore Reef
area apart from either Timor or the Carnarvon Basin.
Due to the angular unconformity on seismic records at
the base of the Uppermost Jurassic volcanics, this
uplifting phase of the area probably occurred in pre-
late Jurassic but post-late Triassic times. The area
remained above wave base (except for a minor phase at
the close of Jurassic) until Upper Cretac ous times.

The presence of the thick incompletely drilled sequence
of Upper Trlassic beds is problematical because of
their clastic character and southeasterly sedimentary
dip. Thus a clastic source area must be Invoked in the
area northwest of Ashmore Reef. However, the Ladinian
through Norian Aitutu formation In Portugese Timor
comprises 804 calcilutite, 158 shales and only 52
calcarenites, quartz arenites and radiolarites., Thus
the postulated landmass northwest of Ashmore did not
contribute significant amounts of clastic material to
Portugese Timor.

The presence of Upper Jurassic vo|canics are not
serlously detrimental to petroleum prospects In older
beds. The areal distribution of these volcanics on
the Sahul Shelf is unknown.

Rocks at Ashmore Reef No.l which were found porous and
hence are.regionally potential reservoir rocks on the
Sahul Shelf are the upper calcarenite facies of the
'Hibernia beds! and the upper portion of the unnamed
Upper Triassic clastic sequence. The porous Miocene
beds could be prospective In other parts of the Sahul
Shelf if these can be found beneath an effective cap
rock.

The Gamma Ray tool failed to function which was unfortunate as a direct shale
reading would have been useful. Ei

The interval 1168-985 feet is badly washed out in bands and quantitative
interpretation in this interval is difficult. The interval 1168-2635 feet

is remarkably close to gauge and is suitable for quantitative work. The

interval 2635-3650 is more shaly and the hole averages about 13 inches
“diameter. A slight drift on the S.P. is present but most of the magnetism
- seen on Run No.1 has been removed.

ks

Il. NOTES
(a) Rw

There is no S.P. deflection throughout most of the logged interval
indicating that Rw and Rmf are very close. The calculated
formation water salinity is in the order of 30,000 ppm NaC|.

Two zones immediately below 2635 feet give moderately high salinity “
and below this depth a marked positive shitt in the S.P. base line
occurs.

(b) Rt

The induction curve which approximates Rt is generally less than
4 ohm but shows thin peaks up to 4.5 ohms over tight zones.

(Cc) Porosity

Porosities as determined from Formation Density are generally
lower than those derived from the Sonic Log due to shaliness .
and possibly due to lack of consolidation. A slight decrease
in sonic transit time on the Sonic Log between 1380 ft. and
2635 ft. suggests increased compaction while on the Formation
H . Density Log a marked decrease in average bulk density suggests
i a marked increase in compaction.

GEOLOGY

R.W. Craig

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK:

Field activity on the part of the oil exploration industry in
the Ashmore Reef area of the Sahul Shelf began in 1963 with the
conduct of a reconnaissance aeromagnetic survey by Aero Service
Limited on behalf of Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co. N.L. Profile
lines run in the Ashmore Reef area consisted of a northwest line to

'the reef, a northeast line to Hibernia Reef and a southeast line
back shoreward to Cartier Reef. With hindsigktit is interesting to,
Note that these broad reconnaissance data yielded a depth estimate
to magnetic basement of 7000 feet at a point immediately north of
Ashmore Reef. However, with the indications of thick sedimentary
section yielded by the following described seismic surveys, these
loosely controlled data were considered unreliable.

Initial seismic investigations of the general Ashmore Reef area
were undertaken in 1964 by B.O.C. of Australia Limited, Operator for
the Group tenement holders. Included in the seismic survey which was
shot by Western Geophysical Company of America but interpreted by
Seismograph Services Limited of London were a suite of reflection
lines around Scott and Seringapatam Reefs and a northeastern trending
step-like pattern of east-west and north-south lines which passed
south and east of Ashmore Reef.

In 1965, the Montobel lo-Mermaid Shoal seismic survey included
additlonal reflection selsmic south, cast, and north of Ashmore Reef.
These data indicated for the first time the presence of a sizeable
structure associated with Ashmore Reef.

i
i
|

Therefore the 1966 Rankin-Troubadour seismic survey included
lines which boxed in Ashmore Reef and which served to del ineate the
size, orientation and magnitude of the east-west longitudional ly
faulted Ashmore Reef anticline.

In early 1967 the Ashmore Reef shallow water marine seismic
survey was specifically undertaken to investigate the geographic
relationship between the anticlinal apex and the lagoon and islands
of the reef as well as to confirm the magnitude of southwestern
closure on the structure. As a result of this survey it was confirmed i
that the apex of the structure lay to the northeast of the reef proper i
and the islands are at considerably lower structural elevations on the
south and southwest flanks of the structure.

STRATIGRAPHY

The ages assigned the various stratigraphic units penetrated at
Ashmore Reef are based on palynological studies by B.E. Balme and on
palaeontological studies by P.J. Coleman, both of the University of
Western Australia, Perth and on micropalaeontologi cal studies by Dr.
D.J. Belford of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Canberra.

Informal stratigraphical names are put forward for three Tertiary- /
Upper Cretaceous units and for the Upper Jurassic volcanic sequence. F
This has been done after discussion with Dr. N.H. Fisher, Secretary of 7

Hole size 124 inches.

(b) Rw

This parameter was derived using the SP curve. The values abtained above
7900 feet may be somewhat high, as the mud was more sal ine while drilling
above this depth. Thus true Rnf and consequentiy true Rw, may be lower.

Sidewal! Cores as specified in Appendix

The 9-5/8" casing shoe was located at 8140 ft. and the bottom of the
83" hole was logged at 10,171 ft.

The memoriser of the conductivity curve failed during the Induction
Electric Survey and a re-run was made. During the Sonic/Gamma Ray/
Caliper Survey a hydraulic pressure leak caused the tension to slack
off in the Rucker Compensating System, and resulted in unacceptable
errors in the depth scale of the Schlumberger logs. After repairs to.
the hydraulic system the survey was re-run.

"The survoys wore Initially Intondod for consolldatlon purposes but
examination of the |.E.S. suggested certain lithological anomalies.
To resolve these problems the Formation Density Log and sidewall cores .
were added to the programme. After taking 17 cores a fault in the
electrical circuits terminated the operation and remaining cores will
be taken during the next surveys.

Below the 9-5/8" shoe, down to 9138 feet, the hole is washed out to-
an average diameter of 11 inches. Below 9138 feet the hole condition
is better, having an average size of 9 inches, with maxima and minima
of 9-3/4 inch and 85 inches, respectively.

The following interval velocities were calculated from the integrated

Thickness Travel-Time Velocity

JInterval (fr.) Ft.) (m-sec.) (ft./sec)

The surveys revealed firstly, that the interbedded volcanics logged: in
drill cuttings below 9400 feet are not present and secondly that. U
areanaceous beds extend upwards to at least 9143 feet.

The interval between 9143 feet and 8950 feet cannot be shale because k
of its low radioactivity and is probably weather basalt or tuff but) “v
final definition must await confirmatory sidewall cores during the
next log run.

The foilowing general subdivisions are tentatively proposed:-

Unit A 8140 - 8950 Volcanics - definitely
8950 - 9143 Volcanics - possibly tuft.

Unit B 9143 - 9675 Sandstone, massive very fine grained
| (Sand/Shale Ratio 1:0.61)

unit C 9675 - 10170 Siltstones with massive beds very fine
" grained sandstone and occasional bands

The cavings from the volcanics present below the 9-5/8" casing have:
badiy contaminated the underiying succession to an extent not
realised while drilling. While drilling, the extremely fine grained
sandstones were broken up and the grains passed completely through
the screens. Normally this would have been recorded .in the flow line
'mud sample, but with the high mud volumes and slow penetration rate,
the sand quantities did not rise above 15. :

G) The logged interval is entirely water bearing. The salinity
of the water is approximately 85,000 ppm.

(ii) Three lithostratigraphic units are suggested although final
definition must await further sidewall cores. It is certain
that there are no interbedded voicanics below 9400 feet and
it is very probable that volcanics are absent below 9143 feet.

Porosity

The sonic-derived porosity values were. used as it appears that these
are nearest to the true porosity. The neutron yields high porosities
in the sandstone ranges, indicating shaliness. The Formation Density

is inconsistent.

In the ranges above 11,500!, 12360! - 125501 and

12575! - 12600! the Density ylelds higher porosities than the Sonic, but
in the other limestones below 12000! it yields excessively low porosities.

The details of these units are given in an appendix (Geology)
to this section of the report and are set out graphically on the
composite log of Plate 4.

Quaternary/P| iocene

Unnamed carbonates - (seabed-1053')

The Quaternary/Pl iocene sediments can be subdivided into two
lithologic units. An upper white foraminiferal limestone with minor
lamellibranchs and coral fragments persists from the sea floor (160
feet subdatum) to 540 feet (380 feet thick). These beds exhibit good
intergranular porosity, loss of circulation was experienced in the
interval 400-495 feet and the same lithology is there assumed. Between
540 feet and 1053 feet (513 feet thick) a white to cream, very fine to
fine grained calcarenite which is poorly sorted and consists of angular
calcareous fragments is the major lithology with minor crystal line
limestone interbeds.

"The basal contact is well marked on the induction electric log
by a marked increase in resistivity and on the compensated formation
density log by a sharp increase in density. Palaeontologicaliy the
contact is bracketted by possible Pliocene beds in the lower portion
of the interval 600-1000 feet (from cuttings analysis) and by a
probable late Lower but possibly early Middle Miocene age assignment
for core No.1 at 1125 feet. The contact is therefore unconformable
with Quaternary/Pliocene beds resting on Miocene beds.

Late Middle to early Lower Miocene
Unnamed carbonates - (1053'-2635')

This interval may be subdivided into two lithological units, an
upper 329 feet (1053'-1382') of white to cream foraminiferal limestone
with minor interbeds of greyish green calcareous mudstone and a lower
1253 feet (1382'-2635') of white to light brown very finely crystalline,
partly dolomitic limestone in which foraminiferal content increases
downwards.

The basal contact of these unnamed beds is well marked on the
induction electric log by a marked decrease in resistivity and on the
sonic log by an increase in interval transit time. The base of these
beds is coincident with a disconformable seismic event. Palaeontologically
the lower contact is bracketted by a Lower Miocene age assignment to I a
cores No.2 (2286'-23101) and No.3 (2619'-2632!') and by an early Lower !

. Miocene (Aquitanian or Tertiary upper "e") assignment to core No.4

(2901|'-2928'). Therefore the basal contact is believed to represent
an intra-Lower Miocene disconformity. , - :

Early Lower Miocene

Unnamed beds - (2635'-3062')

This unnamed 427 foot interval is characterized by the first down-
wards appearance of calcilutite as interbeds in a cryptocrystalline and

foraminiferal limestone (to 2818') or a mariy, foraminiferal limestone

evidenced by the marly nature of the foraminiferal limestones. It is
marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in resistivity, on

. FORMATION TEST

The formation test at 9230 feet recovered 10750 ccs of mud filtrate
and 2250 ces of mixture of 10 - 135 formation water and 90 - 879 mud
filtrate. The components of the mixture are estimated from the.
salinities of the sample, mud filtrate and the formation water. The
salinity of the formation water is derived from the SP curve.

Maximum formation pressure measured was 4120 p.s.i.

Permeability was calculated to be 2.75 mds. This very low figure is
presumably caused by "mudding" of the formation adjacent to the

borehole.” It is very likely that if a conventional production test
was conducted the formation would be cleaned up and a more reasonable
permeability would be indicated. " .

formation water is 100,000 ppm NaCl above 12,200 feet and 50,000 ppm,

base of volcanilcs is at 9143 feet.

VELOCITY SURVEY

ASHMORE REEF NO.! WELL
by
B.O.C. OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED

Introduction

. B.O.C. of Australia Limited contracted Western Geophysical Company
of America to perform the velocity survey. Under the contract Western
agreed to furnish the following:

Two Gulf-type Model GCE101 Pressure Sensitive Well Geophones
One Amplitfier case including 12 S.I.E. P-11l Amplifier channels
One Amplifier case including 2 Water Break Amplifiers

One S.|.E. PRO-11 Camera with 12 gal vanometer elements

Two battery type blasters

Two Kaar TR327 radios (Citizens Band type)

One portable developing system

Necessary power supplies, cabling etc.

In addition Western furnished one observer and one shooter. The
survey was conducted on the 23rd and 24th of March 1968, at times
convenient for the well operation.

Survey Procedures

The survey was conducted in very calm weather and at the Neap Tide
period, when the tidal variations of the water level were very small. .

1. Shot Positioning

The shots were fired to the northeast and southwest of the well.
A reference geophone was lowered 25 teet below the water in the moonpool
of the rig and was used to record the water break. The distances that

shots were fired from the well were calculated from the water break times.

2. Explosives

Fifty pound charges of Dupont Nitromon WW were used for ali well
geophone stations. The majority of shot to well distances were between
1500 and 2000 feet.

' 3. Well Geophone Positioni ng

All depth measurements were made using the Schlumberger depth
indicator and | compensat ions were made for the tidal variations of the
sea.

The following procedure was used to keep the geophone stationary
in the bore hole when the shots were fired: “the marine riser was
disconnected from the derrick tfioor and lowered to the casing top,
the Schlumberger cable was clamped with a T-bar device and the cable
was lowered until the T-bar rested on top of the marine riser.

Instrumentation

The seismic instruments were set up behind the Schlumberger unit,
on the port side of the upper deck on the "Investigator". The location
permitted good communication with Schlumberger and the derrick floor.
Eight traces were utilised on the survey records. Traces 1 through 4
monitored the well geophone at four different gain levels. Traces 5
and 6 monitored the well reference geophone in the moonpool.' The time
break was recorded on trace 7. Trace 8 was used for the 100 cycle
timing checker trace. On the amplitfiers receiving signals from the
well geophone, wide band filtering, and fixed-gain recording mode were


-2-

used throughout the survey. :.The master gain levels were varied betw n
shots in anticipation of the signal strengths to b recorded. Signals
from the well reference geophone in the moonpool were passed through the
.two specially designed water break amplitiers.

.Resulis

. Shots were fired with the well geophone stationed at sixteen differ nt
levels, ranging from 1360 to 12,710 feet below the Mean Low Water Spring
tide datum. Check shots from opposing. sides of the well were obtained at
five different levels.

The results of the velocity survey have been shown on the attach d:
computation sheet and graph. The record quality varied from good fo
questionable, the majority being fair. Adequate check shots were obtain d-
:'to yleld a reliable survey. JUD). o KURO

. Conclusions a o

(1) The velocity survey will provide identification for the seismic
reflection horizons recorded in the vicinity of the well.

(2) The velocity survey data comparable to the integrated Sonic Log data, .
show fairly good overall agreement. .|t is felt that where the Sonic Logs.
are of good quality, a limited number of check shots, with the gecphon “a
stationed at intervals In excess of 2,000 feet, would be sufficient to
:provide absolute times to tie the Integrated Sonic data.

the sonic log by an increase in interval transit time, and on the
formation density log by a marked decrease in density. Seismically,
this interval is apparently confined to a local area at Ashmore
Reef. Elsewhere it is truncated by a post-early Lower Miocene
unconformity, late Lower Miocene, or younger beds rest directly

on the Oligocene 'Cartier beds'.

Oligocene
'Cartier beds! - (3062!-4009')

The 'Cartier beds' are a gradational and interbedded sequence
ot marl and shale. Mari is the sole lithology to 3413 feet (351

'teet thick) where shale interbeds first appear and become dominant

downwards to 3648 feet (235 feet thick). Shale is the sole lithology
from 3648 feet to 3887 feet (239 feet thick) where mari reappears and
becomes dominant to the base of the 'Cartier beds! at 4009 feet (122
feet thick). . i

The basal contact of the 'Cartier beds' is lithological ly
abrupt and marked on the wireline logs by a marked increase in
S.P., a marked decrease in interval transit time and decrease in
both gamma radiation and density. .

Palaeontologically Coleman has bracketted the upper contact with
an early Lower Miocene age assignment to a sidewall core at 3045 feet
and an Oligocene age assignment of a sidewall core at 3065'. Concerning
the age of the lower portion of this sequence Coleman has assigned an
Oligocene age to core No.7 (3622'-3645') and an Upper Eocene age to
:core No.8 (4040|1-4063') from just below the basal contact. Therefore
the 'Cartier beds! are considered entirely Ol igocene in age with the
possibility that the basal disconformity represents a part of the
Lower Oligocene. -

Upper Eocene-Lower Paleocene
'Hibernia beds! - (40091-6543!)

The 'Hibernia beds! are a thick (2534 feet) gradational series of
several carbonate rock types. Calcarenite prevails to 4209 feet and
remains dominant with minor interbeds of calcilutite to 4484 feet where
calcilutite prevails through to 4760 feet. Calcarenite briefly reappears
between 4760 feet and 4783 feet. The interval between 4783 and 5556
feet is an interbedded sequence of calcilutite and calcisiltite with
the calcisiltite gradational ly becoming dominant downwards. Between
5556 feet and 5730 feet calcisiltite is the sole lithologic component.
Calcilutite is the dominant lithology between 5730 feet and 6177 feet
but with minor interbeds of calcarenite and shale. “Micro- to crypto-
crystalline limestone is the dominant lithology between 6177 feet and
6543 feet but calcilutite interbeds persist downwards to about 6250
feet. The limestone becomes gradational to marl near the base. Chert
nodules and irregular thin bands are present throughout the 'Hibernia

beds'.

Due to “ie gradational nature of the composite rock types it is
not felt meaningful to subdivide the 'Hibernia beds! into lithological
units. The basal contact, although somewhat gradational, is fairly wel!
marked lithologically by the first prominent appearance of marl. The
contact is marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in both
S.P. and resistivity and on the sonic log by an increase in interval
transit time. The basal contact coincides with a strong mappable seismic

porosity is present.

DESCRIPTION

LIMESTONE, white to cream, fragments vary
from fine to very coarse, minor fossil
fragments mainly foraminifera, good inter-
granular and vugular porosity.

Two types are
present with both grading into each other.

(1) White to cream, composed of cream
caicareous clastics (1 mm. to maximum of
2 cms.) and foraminifera (405 of rock) as
well as minor fragments of light grey to
light blue calcareous clastics. All are
set in a light brown to cream calcareous
cement which contains significant numbers
of small well formed calcite or dolomite
crystals. Good intergranular and vugular,
porosity is present throughout. Semi-
consol idated.

(2) Light brown, composed of up to 608
forams generally white, minor black ones.
Porosity is fair to poor and mostly
vugular. Harder than type (1). No
petroleum indications.

CALCILUTITE, light grey to light brown
crossed horizontal ly by large numbers of
white and dark grey calcareous streaks.
Fossils (304 foraminifera) generally lie
parallel to colour bands. Approximately

405 of the rock is cream calcareous clastics
set in a light grey to light brown cement or
matrix, poor vugular porosity, interbedded
with Coquinite light and dark grey, hard,
well compacted grading into the calcilutite.
Foraminifera are present with the two large
torams dominant. (One is biconvex and tends
to distort the other disc shaped type. The
latter is dominant and has distinct concentric
ornament. Increasing numbers of a black
biconvex foram are present towards the base.
Porosity poor. 1t is probable that there is
little to no dip.

CALCILUTITE: white to light grey, generally
clay sized with the white zones rich in silt
sized calcite grains. From 2907 to 2912 ft.

. SHALE: grey, fissile, silty in part, argilla-

ceous, slightly micaceous and up to 258
calcareous with very fine unidentifiable
fossil fragments as well as minor foraminifera
often replaced by pyrite. Towards the base,
areas of light grey fragments of micro-
crystalline limestone occur up to 2" across,
generally partly rounded with a sharp contact
with the surrounding Shale. These are probably
clastics and are much harder than the Shale.
The fissility would indicate probably zero
dip. No indication of hydrocarbons.

CALCARENITE: white to light brown, granular,
with equal amounts of silt sized, very fine
grained and fine grained, calcareous clastics,
slightly dolomitic and fossiliferous with thin
bands rich in elongated fragments, possibly

fossil remains, good to fair intergranular

porosity.

A possible break in deposition occurs at 4059'6"
where there is a sharp break downwards from
white to light blue calcareous material. This
grades back to the white to light brown type by

.4060'6"., Above this disconformity are very

thin laminations of black possibly carbonaceous
and or ferruginous material which are primary
bedding structures. Secondary structures or
Styolites are present throughout. All styolites
show only minor irregularity, i.e. they do not
appear as a wriggly trace but as a straight or
curved line.

Dip: Nil, strong odour of HS when core is
broken.

CALCILUTITE: white to cream, microcrystal line,
almost entirely calcareous with fossils common

:throughout. Porosity is fair to poor and is

probably intergranular and vugular. Most vugs
seen are associated with fossils. Chemical
structures including nodules and styolites

are present throughout. Nodules composed
entirely of Chert are found in the top six

feet of the core. They vary from 5" to 4"
across. They have a regular outline but are
often branching. Styolites are rare and poorly
developed. Towards the base, zones enriched
with glauconite or chlorite are present. The
basal and most outstanding zone has a sharp
upper contact with the base grading back into
the Calcilutite. Large amounts of. pyrite often
in cubes are present in this zone which extends
across most of the core.

Fossils include Pelecypods, Foramini fera and
Crustacea. No apparent dip, strong sulphide
odour when core is broken. .

CALCILUTITE: cream to light brown, micro-
crystalline, or microgranular, almost entirely
calcareous minor pyrite throughout, general ly
in cube form, fossils absent. Porosity is

poor and where present is a result of
tracturing. This is particularly apparent

at the base of the core where there is a
slickenslide coated with clear crystals of
dolomite. Throughout.the core but more
concentrated in the top foot are laminations
slightly darker than the surrounding material,

still very caicareous and probably due to
increasing amounts of carbonaceous or argilla-
ceous material. These are completely irregular

and change shape and direction consi derably.
Also present throughout are well developed

styolites.

Dip: probably horizontal with a strong

. sulphide odour when core is broken.

CALCILUTITE: light buff grey, dense, tough,
composed essentially of calcareous mud,

probably mainly of clastic rather than chemical
origin, small fraction of quartzose silt, non
calcareous clay and silt sized grains of a black
mineral dispersed through the rock, calcareous
cement: irregular bands and patches of very

fine grained Calcarenite (a slightly coarser
version of the Calcilutite) and of small streaks
of dark grey and black carbonaceous material,
indicate a lack of dip or very low dip. Light
bluish grey nodules of Chert with off-white
haloes and irregular to rounded shapes commonly
less than an inch across are scattered through-
out the core, the nodules which are only slightly
calcaroous are of secondary origin. The core Is
intersected by many irregular fractures whIch
commonly dips at high angles: fracture planes
show developed slickensides which impari a
styolitic appearance, fracture planes are

lined with fine calcite crystals and a dark
carbonaceous material. lIntergranular porosity
is very poor.

LIMESTONE: mottled light greenish-grey, massive,
tight, microcrystal line with scattered lath-like
aggregates (mainly less than 4" long) of very
finely crystalline pyrite and other dark minerals:
the laths are surrounded by very light green
limestone (suggesting secondary origin ? replace-
ment of organic matter) which gives the rock a
faint mottling, the laths are elongate, both
normal and parallel to the length of the core.
Very thin wavy and sub-horizontal laminae of

dark Shale appear noticeably at about 6024 teet,
the laminae become more obvious downwards and

at 6025.5 feet, several Shale laminae in a zone
about 1" thick are present. The SHALE is firm
to hard, fissile, calcareous and slightly pyritic,
silty, carbonaceous and micaceous. The Limestone
grades downwards into CALCILUTITE which is semi-
crystalline. in the upper part only. It grades
from very light greenish-grey to creamy-buff,

it consists of calcareous mud and silt (partly
recrystallised in the upper part) bound into a
firm rock with calcareous cement, quartzose

silt and non-calcareous clay form about 10-205

of the rock, silt-sized grains of pyrite and a

'black mineral are scattered through the rock.

Several zones, up to 4" thick, of wavy
laminations and streaks of dark Shale are
present, the zones are commonly associated
with well-developed styolites. The
calcilutite shows several small-scale
sedimentational structures including load-
casts, convolutions and flame structures,
shaly laminae are depressed below and arched
over, pillow-like structures, which appear to
be load-casts, the sedimentational structures
give the rock a faint mottling. Several | ight
grey rounded CHERT nodules, about an inch
across, are present in the calcilutite, one
nodule has a styolitic boundary with the host
rock and shaly laminae are arched over it.

At about 6037 feet several dark bluish patches
with irreguiar outl ines, consist in part of

:crystals of calcite and very finely crystal line

pyrite, with rims highly concentrated in pyrite,
the origin of the bluish colour is unknown.
Irregular fractures intersect the calcilutite

at high angles, the fractures are lined with
calcite in places. The shaly laminae indicate
negligible dip. Very poor intergranular porosity
is probably present in the non-crystal l ine
calcilutite.

Fracture porosity is also present.

LIMESTONE: with minor thin beds enriched with
argi llaceous material.
Limestone, white to cream, made up mainly of

“clay or smaller than clay sized particles with

large amounts of microcrystalline calcite and

up to 206 argillaceous material, slightly

pyritic associated with a black metallic like
mineral, very minor carbonaceous material and
clear angular quartz grains. Porosity is poor

to nil and due entirely to fractures. Approxi-
mately vertical fractures often less than j"
apart are present throughout. Brecciated zones
associated with these are also present. Crystals
of calcite are often present along these fractures.
Evidence of faulting in the form of a pronounced
slickenside surface is present at 6524'. This
runs at an angle of 40 degrees and has a coating
of argillaceous material. Running parallel with
this are a number of minor fractures. The Lime-
stone is compact dnd hard. Argillaceous rich
bands up to 3" thick are present throughout with
an upper gradational surface with the Limestone
and generally a sharp lower boundary. Thin
argil laceous and possibly carbonaceous lamel lae
are present with no less than 654 calcareous
material. “These lamellae can be extremely thin
and irregular in shape and extent. They indicate
a possible dip of up to 10 degrees.

CALCILUTITE' white to cream, entirely clay sized,
hard with 904 calcareous material, minor pyrite
and quartz, rare glauconite and fossils. Porosi ty
is poor to nil. Two Styolites are present both
approximately 4" thick and both made up of partly
calcareous, argillaceous and phosphatic material.
No fracturing is present in this interval.

CALCAREQOUS SHALE, grey to green with all
particles clay sized, fissile, slightly
glauconitic and pyritic, up to 258 calcareous
material. All pieces disintegrate readily.
Dark streaks bearing no relation to the
bedding are present throughout. These have
a greater calcareous content than the
surrounding material. 1t is possible that
some of glauconite present has replaced the
original forams. There is a sharp break
with the overlying calcilutite which is
probably a disconformity only.

MARL, grey entirely clay sized, fissile with
less glauconite than previous interval, minor
pyrite with up to 508 calcareous material. It
is also harder and does not disintegrate as
readily as the previous interval. Slickenside
surfaces indicating minor faulting is present
in both argi | laceous intervals.

MARL grading into thin beds of CALCILUTITE.

MARL: light and dark grey, grading from equally
calcareous and argil laceous to 755 calcareous,
fissile pyritic with large grains of pyrite up

to an inch in diameter, also replacing or
infilling fossils, minor amounts of flaky
elongated chiorite. This is probably chamosite
and replaces compressed fossil remains.
individual beds or laminae of marl with the

same calcareous content are generally thin

i.e. the core is composed of a large number of
thin grey and dark grey areas with the dark
grey,areas containing increased amounts of
argillaceous material. Boundaries are grada-
tional. lrregularly shaped darker areas are
also common and were probably pockets of more
argillaceous o0zes. Often these are composed

of predominantly silt sized material. Unidentifi-
able fossil. remains and foraminifera are present
throughout.

CALCILUTITE: white to light grey, probably rarely
crystalline, composed almost entirely of clay
sized material, approximately 808 calcareous
with most of the remainder argillaceous, partly
pyritic with fossils common, also containing
darker irregular bodies of more argi | laceous
material as present in the Marl. The upper
boundaries of the Calcilutite beds (range up to
6" thick) are quite often sharp while there is
always a gradation of the lower boundary into a
Mari.

A zone of Marl at 7260! indicates a dip of
approx. 2-3 degrees as well as minor compaction
before the deposition of the overlying rock.

The water current appears to have eroded this
surface forming a microintraformational breccia
above the darker Mari.

are present as dark brown calcareous outl ines
infilled with the microcrystal line groundmass.
This groundmass contains numerous dark brown
calcite. fragments which vary from 0.5mm down
to approx. the same size as the surrounding
material.

Styolites are present throughout particularly
in the darker zones in which there can be up
to four per foot. They vary in thickness
from very thin traces up to 3" thick and are
composed entirely of limonite. Any colour
changes in the Limestone occurs across these
styolites. On rare occasions crystals of

dfibrous calcite also occur in the styolites.

Vertical fractures are common and offen only
3" apart. A fault plane is present at the

'base of the core associated with minor

brecciation as well as fibrous calcite

“recrystallization along the fault plane. A

slickenside surface is also associated with
this fault.

Porosity is poor and never exceeds 105. 1t"

SHALE: dark grey 'to black, hard, massive when
fresh but fissile when dry, occasional shell
fragments and crinoids, otherwise only very
slightly calcareous or non-calcareous, very
fine mica flakes throughout, rare pods of
pyrite, glauconitic, current bedded.

BASALT: black, composed predominantly of black

and green phenocrysts of pyroxene and olivine

set in a black pyroxene and felspathic ground-
mass. No other minerals including quartz appear
to be present. The core is completely homogenous
except for an irregularly shaped zone of chlorite
and calcite approx. 3" thick at 8285! and a Im
thick darker and finer grained bed of volcanic
material at the base of the core. Surrounding
this irregular vein of chlorite and calcite, the
Fock has been altered to a light brown colour.
The alteration extends no more than 3" into the
volcanic material. 5

The dark band at the base of the core would
indicate that the dip does not exceed 5 degrees.

WEATHERED BASALT: dark grey, hard but containing
large numbers. of very thin hairlike fractures
mostiy filled with a light blue-green mineral,
also contains quite large numbers of irregularly
shaped vesicles and amygdales of calcite. All
tend to be elongated at approx. 45 degrees to
the axis of the core. The groundmass is black
and contains numerous grains of a black mineral
rarely greater than | mm. across. These tend
to be lineated in approx. the same direction

as the elongated amygdales mentioned above.

The fractures are probably due to movement of
the lava just prior to solidification.

reflection. Coleman and Belford have both assigned cores No.8 (4040!-
4063!) and No.9 (4540|-4566') an Upper Eocene age. Neither palaeontologist
was successful in obtaining identifiable material from cores No.10 or 11
(5020'-5035') and (5535'-5553!).. Belford has assigned core No.12 a basal

Eocene or Upper Paleocene age and core No.13 an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman,

in contrast, has nominated a Middle to Lower Paleocene age for the interval
represented by these cores based on his tentative identifications of
several early Globorotalia species.

The formation is regarded as ranging in age through the Eocene and
part of the Paleocene.

Upper Cretaceous
'Woodbine beds! - (6543!-7956!)

The 'Woodbine beds' are a further gradational series of three basic
carbonate lithologies. Although the sequence is gradational it may be
useful! to consider the following subdivision units:

6543'-6857! (314 feet)  Marl, light green to dark grey, about 555
calcareous, slightly glauconitic, with
interbeds of white to cream microcrystal line
limestone. Calcareous shale at 6732-6739
feet.

6857'-7007' (150 feet)  Limestone, essentially as above, with
Marl interbeds below 6980 feet.

7007|-7440! (433 feet) Calcilutite and Mari

Do " Calcilutite, white to light brown, litho-
graphic, grades into light grey, light
green and dark grey marl, 65-505
calcareous, argillaceous, pyritic,
chloritic. Marl is dominant in the
interval 7188 feet to 7273 feet.

7440'-7688! (248 feet) Limestone, light brown to brown, micro-
crystalline, variable minor ferruginous
or manganese material, abundant limonite
styolites throughout and iron-rich chert
nodules towards base. :

. 7688'-7956! (268 feet) Mari, light greenish grey, 404 calcareous,
grading downwards to calcilutite, 3654
calcareous, below 7835 feet.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds' is easily recognised | ithological iy
by the abrupt change to shales below. The-induction electric log exhibits
a downwards decrease in resistivity while the gamma-sonic shows an
increase in gamma radiation and an increase in interval transit time.

The gradational relationship of the lithology of the upper portion
of the 'Woodbine beds' to the overlying 'Hibernia beds' has already been
discussed. Also, the difficulties in nominating a stage within the
Paleocene for basal 'Hibernia beds' has been pointed out. Within the
Woodbine beds' Coleman initially assigned an Upper Cretaceous age to
core No.14 (6730|-6748!) based on thin section identifications. (He
had been unable to recover free specimens from digested samples).

Fluorescence: brown organic remains in both

The Sandstone and the Shale exhibit a dull

gold fluorescence with a strong bluish white
cut. Although the Sandstone does not exhibit
any f#luorescence it gives a light green solvent
#luorescence. Ncither types of fluorescence
effect the colour of the solvent.

The solvent with the carbonaceous remains was a
very pale yellow but this was probably due to
the carbonaceous material, not the fluorescing
material.

The fluorescent solvent was left to stand with

a piece of absorbent paper immersed in it.

(2) Sandstone solvent fluorescence,

This had two indistinct rings. The lower.one is
brown and approx. 0.4" thick. Above this is a
pale yellow band approximately 0.3 inches thick.
There is a poorly defined graduation between the

quartz, silt grains set in dark grey crypto-
erystalline calcareous cement 605. Uneven :
discontinuous thin bands, finely laminated, i
non porous.

FRAGMENTAL FOSSILIFEROUS LIMESTONE, 825 carbonate
light grey, finely crystalline, hard, dense,
abundant shells, minor black silty Shale
laminations contorted due to consolidation, non
porous, silty fraction quartzose.

SHALE, very dark grey, blocky, compact, non-
calcareous, micromicaceous with larger flakes

on bedding planes, fine pyrite and pods of

pyrite up to 5" thick, carbonaceous throughout,
light grey silty laminations and elongated pods
of dark brown Shale (? worm borings), thin

layers of coal fragments, one mixed with calcite.
Laminations are rarely continuous, being mostly
wavy, broken and, in one place, slumped. Steep
fractures throughout, filled with dolomite from
11,722'3" to 11,722'7", otherwise with no filling.

CALCAREQUS SIALE, light grey, very brittle and
hard, containing thin discontinuous lighter grey,
more calcareous bands, slightly pyritic and
dolomitic.

SHALE.

LIMESTONE, dark brown, either sublithographic or
cryptocrystalline, between 90 and 1005 calcareous
slightly pyritic, minor black fossil remains all
probably the same Brachiopod with a pronounced
crenulate ornament, numerous thin veins of calcite
and one large vein of dickitel?). The Limestone
towards the base has areas rich in clear trans-
parent crystals of dolomite. SHALE, dark grey non-
fissile, up to 204 calcareous, partly pyritic,



completely irregularly distributed. throughout,
slightly fossiliterous. Structure Core is
made up of large fragments of Limestone from
6" to 2 feet thick separated by thin Shale
zones. These zones generally have a sharp
.boundary with the Limestone and show quite !
a marked lineation of fossil and fine Limestone.. |

PAGSAKAAND AN PIGHAK:

6.

Beiford, however, was successful in obtaining free specimens and, as

a result, nominated an Upper Paleocene age. Coleman has since seen some

ot Belford's material and (verbal communication) concurs in a Paleocene

age assignment. Core No.15 (7252'-7267') has been assigned a Maestrichtlan
age by both workers whereas Core No.16 (7575'-7590') is regarded as
Maestrichtian by Coleman and as Santonian or Campanian by Belford. Sidewall
core from 7891 feet and cuttings between 7700 and 7950 feet were analysed
without firm results. Coleman, however, does suggest that the interval
represents the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous and possibly part of the
Lower Cretaceous as well. In the absence of firm palaeontological evidence
the writer would prefer to regard the 'Woodbine beds' as being Paleocene
through Upper Cretaceous with no Lower Cretaceous present.

The base of the 'Woodbine beds! coincides with a regional ly mappable
seismic disconformity. :

White the subdivision of the conformable and gradational sequence of
Eocene-Paleocene carbonates into two "formations", the 'Hibernia beds!
above and 'Woodbine beds' below, has been recommended on the basis of
the regional mappability of the boundary by seismic means, it is to be
emphasized that the succession is conformable and comprises several cycles
of carbonate sedimentation. i

Upper Jurassic
Unnamed sediments - (7956'-8102')

The interval 7956 feet to 8031 feet consists of dark grey to black
slightly to non-caicareous shale with very fine mica, minor pyrite and
glauconite, minor fossils, and with current bedding. The underlying
23 foet (8031'-8054!) consists of Iithic sandstone, groen to grey,
medlum grained, domInantly argil laceous with gralns of opaque volcanics
and rare quartz, fresh feldspar, fossillferous with a green highly glauconitic
matrix. The basal unit of this unnamed sedimentary sequence consists of
48 feet (8054'-8102') of light brown to greenish grey calcarenite
containing subangular to subrounded dark greenish grey volcanic fragments
and subangular hard calcite fragments in a cryptocrystal line matrix,

. slightly fossiliferous, rarely ferruginous.

Core No.17 (8016'-8023') from near the base of the shale Interval
yielded no useful macro or microfossils. However, Balme recovered spores
and pollen which are not chronologically significant but are suggestive
of a Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age. The microplankton similarly are
not accurately definitive but the genus Scrinrodinium is apparently typical
of the Upper Jurassic although a species occurs in the Lower Cretaceous of
Western Australia. On balance Balme considers "the assemblage is late
Jurassic although an early Cretaceous age is not out of the question".

Considering that this unnamed sedimentary sequence contains clastic
material derived from the underlying volcanic sequence and, considering also
the relative ages of these sediments and the underlying volcanics, it is
probable that these sequences are essentlatly conformable.

wWbj - 1141m
"Ashmore volcanic beds! - (8102'-9143")

The informally named 'Ashmore volcanic beds! may be subdivided into
two units:

8102'-8172' Altered amygdaloidal basalt, dark grey, with
phenocrysts of pyroxene and probably feldspar in

a matrix of iron oxides including haematite, and
altered feldspar. Irregular aggregates are a
mixture of green chlorite, calcite and a zeoite
and resemble amygdales.

PETROLOGY REPORTS



PETROLOGY AND PETROGRAPHY
OF

SELECTED ROCKS

FOR

ASHMORE REEF WELL No.1

BY

J.E. GLOVER



.

The rocks selected for discussion fall naturally into three groups.
Thes are

CO) the sedimentary rocks from 7950 - 8085 feet inclusive,
(2) #he volcanic rocks from 8106 - 8841.5 feet inclusive, and
B3) the sedimentary rocks from 9295 - 9316 feet Inclusive.

The petrographic descriptions of these rocks are followed by a brief
discussion of their petrology and speculation on some of the events
to their formation.

A report on Cores 25 and 26. as well as cuttings from the intervals
11830 - 11840! and 11930 - 11940! is also included. :

CUTTINGS 9750 - 7960 feet.

Handspecimen

The cuttings include light grey, dark grey and brown, very fine-
gralned rock fragments, and a few muscovite flakes.

Thin section

Gralns included in the thin section range from foraminiferal,
argi llaceous calcilutite to foramini feral, calcareous claystone.

SIDEWALL CORE 39, 7967 foot.

Handspecimen

The material in this specimen consists of friable, pale grey and grey-
green fragments in which it is difficult to distinguish any texture
with the hand lens.

Thin section

The fragments are made up of sedimentary rock particles. One particle
is a foraminiferal calcarenite containing a little silt-sized quartz,
rare brown fragments of possible collophane, and a sand grain of basalt.
Another particle consists of silty, glauconitic, foraminiferal,
calcareous claystone.

CUTTINGS 8020 - 8030 feet.

PAA AA an

Handspec imen

The specimen consists of cuttings of grey sedimentary rock.

Thin section

These cuttings contain fragments of fine-grained dolomite, and three
other sedimentary rock types which are gradational. These are
foraminiferal calcilutite, foraminiferal claystone, and silty,
foraminiferal, glauconitic claystone containing a litti pyrit.



8045 feet.

SIDEWALL CORE 38,

Handspec men

The rock is grey-green, very friable, and is composed mainly of dark
grey and grey-green sand grains. It effervesces locally In. cold
dilute hydrochloric acid.

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone in which most of the grains range between

0.12 - 0.50 mn., are angular to subangular and are opaque. The

opaque grains are either black or dark .grey to red-brown In reflected
light. Although the origin of these grains cannot be determined beyond
doubt, the presence of some dark grains of undoubted basaltic origin
suggests a volcanic derivation for all of them. The clearly basaltic
.grains contain abundant, minute feldspar laths with intergranular

iron oxide grains and a little secondary chlorite. Other material in the
rock includes sili-sized quartz, glauconite, argillaceous material, a
little calcite and rare fragments which seem to be phosphatic

material of organic origin. The rock isa silty, fine to medium grain d,
argi | laceous, glauconitic, lithic sandstone containing grains of basalt.

8050 feet. U

SIDEWALL CORE 37,

Handspecimen

The rock is friable and grey-green, and is made up mainly of sand-
sized grains of grey-green and brown minerals. There is faint
effervescence in cold dilute hydrochloric acid.

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone containing varied debris, including abundant
subangular to subrounded grains of volcanic rock. One volcanic

.grain is composed mainly of almost colourless glass containing a few
laths of feldspar and a little chlorite. Most grains are darker, and
many have an intergranular groundmass with opaque iron oxide filling
#he interstices between minute feldspar laths. Ferromagnesian
minerals, including phenocrysts, seem to have been present, but are
altered beyond recognition. Chlorite is a common secondary mineral
in the volcanic grains. Many of the grains are hemihyal ine and contain
minute laths of feldspar in grey, brown and dark brown glass. Brown
scoriaceous material, sometimes spoken of as thread-lace scoria or
reticulite, is particulariy common as angular to subangular fragments.
The vesicles in this scoria are generally filled with glauconite, which
is also common as discrete sandsized pellets. (Other sandsized grains
in the rock include labrodorite and andesine-fel dspar, quartz and very
rare analcite-nepheline fragments. The grains range mainly between
0.25 - 0.50 mm in diameter, and are cemented locally by calcite and
by an argil laceous matrix. Some of the opaque iron oxide of the
voicanic grains has a red-brown stain in reflected light, despite the
presence of glauconite, which forms in a neutral to somewhat 'reducing
environment.

Thread-lace scorla is one of the products of lava fountains in some
eruptions, but may also form as froth on the crusts of fluid gas-rich
pahoehoe lavas. in other words, i'ts presence in this rock sugg sts
tuffaceous activity, but is not conclusive. Other material, such as



quartz, argillaceous material, and probably the rounded volcanic grains,
are likely to be the products of normal processes of erosion,
transportation, sorting and deposition. Glauconite is an authigenic
mineral. Some of the contributing volcanic material was alkaline,

much of it was obviously basic.

The rock can best be described as a moderately well sorted, medium
.grained, calcareous, glauconitic, possibly partly tuffaceous, lithic
sandstone containing abundant basaltic material.

SIDEWALL CORE 36, 8070 feet.

Handspecimen.

The rock is very friable and grey. Under the hand lens it can be seen
to be made up mainly of grey-green and brown lithic fragments, green

.grains and a white to grey mineral. The rock shows a pronounced
effervescence in cold dilute hydrochloric acid.

Thin section

The rock contains calcareous fossil material, glauconite, and fragments

of volcanic rock. The fossils consist of shell fragments and debris of

probable echinodermal origin, and the volcanic fragments are small and

consist of minute feldspar laths in an opaque groundmass. The rock is

a poorly sorted, glauconitic, fossiliferous calcarenite containing
grains of volcanic rock.

SIDEWALL CORE 35, 8085 feet.

Handspec imen

The rock is friable and is made up of poorly sorted grey-green and
brown lithic fragments in a grey to white matrix which effervesces
strongly in cold, dilute hydrochloric acid.

Thin section i a

The rock is made up of poorly sorted fossiliferous calcarenite
containing abundant grains, granules, and small pebbles, mostly
rounded, of volcanic rock. Much of the volcanic rock is porphyritic
with phenocrysts of altered plagioclase and pale brown augite in an
intergranular groundmass of aligned plagioclase laths, and minute
augite and black iron oxide grains. Chlorite and calcite are common
secondary minerals and appear to fill vesicles in some grains... A
little of the opaque iron-oxide has been changed to haematite. One

“grain of volcanic rock consists of small aligned feldspar laths in
'dark brown glass. There are thus numerous textural and mineralogical
variations in the fragments, but all of them can be referred to basalt.
The rock can be described as:a fossiliferous calcarenite contalning
abundant poorly sorted fragments of basalt.
