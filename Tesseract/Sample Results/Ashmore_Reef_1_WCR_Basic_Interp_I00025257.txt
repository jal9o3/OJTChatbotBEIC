SUMMARY

Ashmore Reef is situated on the outer portion of the Sahul Shelf
immediately south of the Timor Trough . Ashmore Reef No.1 was drilled
with Zapata0.D.E.s drilling barge Investigator to a total depth of

12843 feet .

The well penetrated 893 feetof Quaternary carbonates before
entering a ( 6903 feet thicklpalaeontological ly paraconformable sequence
of early Middie Miocene through Upper Cretaceous predominantly carbonate
beds . Although palaeontological ly paraconformable seismic evidence
suggests that the sequence contains two unconformities one intra

Lower Miocene and one at the base of Oligocene . Three strat igraphic
units are defined from this succession .

Unconformably beneath the Upper Cretaceous beds are a thin ( 146
feet ) sequence of uppermost Jurassic sediments which rest conformably
on 1041 feet of Upper Jurassic volcanics .

The Jurassic volcanics rest unconformably on a penetrated 3700
feet of Upper Triassic predominantly clastic beds to total depth . 1

The only hydrocarbon indications in the well were very minor amounts
ot gas of mainly less than 14 on the gas analyser and apparently
originating from afygdaloidal basalts at the top of the Upper Jurassic
volcanics . They were not significant enough to warrant testing .

Eocene calcarenites and Upper Triassic ciastics are good potential
hydrocarbon reservoirs . Tertiary maris and shales and Upper Triassic
shales are possibly hydrocarbon sourco rocks . The Ashmore Reef structure
was formed In the late Middle Mloceno the age af uplift Is young
relative to sediment deposition thus possibly accounting for the lack
of hydrocarbon shows . This might not be true for other Sahul Shelf
structures with an earlier history of upliftey

ii . 1 NTRODUCT ION

Ashmore Reef is located on the outer portion of the Sahul Shelf
immediately east of the Timor Trough . The wel isite lies in the newly
created Australian Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands . Geoaraphicaily
Ashmore Reef is 400 miles northnortheast of the shorebase of operations
at Broome W.A . and 260 miles northwest of the marine radio navigation
station on Troughton Island off the northern tip of the Kimberley Block .

The wel ! was subsidized as a 12500 foot stratigraphic test to
sample the sedimentary section in the remote Sahul Shelf region of the
Australian Continental Shelf .

DRILLING DATA ( contd . )

26 hole to 1015 !

Drilling was commenced with a low weight high viscosity fresh water
mud treated with up to 10 Ib.bbi . lost circulation material . A
complete loss of circulation occurred . Drilling was continued . .
without returns but as the loss continued cement plugs were placed .
Continued lack of returns necessitated drilling with sea water
without returns . Prior to logging and ruming casing the sea
water was displaced with viscous fresh water mud treated with L.C.M .

173 hole to 3650 !

Driiting was continued with mud containing a high concentration of
lost circulation material . However almost continuous losses
occurred at times up to 120 blis . per hour .

As from the 18th November and when opening the 122 hole to 173
diesel was added to the mud . The oil content ranged between 7105 .

124 hole to 8175 !

Sporadic mud losses up to 150 blday while drilling occurred and
particularly while tripping . Addition of lost circulation material

was sufficient to reduce the loss to an acceptable amount . Periodically
the hole required resting for up to six hours after which the loss
stopped . .

Lost circulation material had to be removed by the shale shaker screens
prior to coring to prevent plugging of the core barrel .

Included as part of the Composite Log .

The variations in the amount of gas in
the drilling mud was continuously
recorded by two gas detectors using
the following principles :

( Ci ) By variation in conductivity of
the gas .

( Ji ) By variation in resistivity of a
hot wire in contact with the gas .

The latter was used also to determine
the type of gasses present and is
presented on the composite log .

All readings were taken using a Lane

Continuous losses of 15 180 bl.hr . occurred while drilling from 20 inch casing
i shoe to approximately 2550 ft. A number of zones within this interval claimed j
up to 90f of the circulation volume and could only be sealed by high viscosity f
i slugs with LCM . Below 2250 ft. losses have been considerably less although t
i minor heavy losses have occurred . At the weekend the losses had stopped .
Mud chemical consumption and stocks have been corrected following physical
check of all stocks . :

Remarks

The hole was opened to 3560 feet and the mud was conditioned prior to running
casing . On the first run the casing held up at 1300 feet and was pulled . The
hole was reamed but during the second run the casing held up at 1375 feet .

The hole was reamed again and the mud viscosity raised . At the third attempt
the 1358 casing was run landed at 3589 feet and cemented using 1400 sacks
Class H. Cement with 65 gel followed by 400 sacks neat cement . Returns of 12 ib.gali
cement contaminated mud were obtained at surface but circulation was lost during the .
last 50 bl . of displacement .

After flushing out kill and choke lines the 20 riser was removed and the 20

B.O.P . stack was pulled . At the end of the week the 1358 inch B.O.P . stack was
being run .

DEVIATION

44 degrees at 9740 ft . The rapid build up of deviation is thought to be result
434 degrees at 9820 ft. of The heave and pitch of the Investigator . By cutting
435 degrees at 9924 ft. back drilling weight and experimenting with . various
stabilizer arrangements the deviation is being

Remarks contained but as yet not significantly reduced .

The rig was made secure during heavy swell associated with tropical cyclone Bertha .

Drilling was suspended at 1900 hrs . on 2011968 on receipt of a warning that
tropical depression Bertha at that time south of Kalumburu would intensify
into a cyclone when it moved offshore . The barge was then experiencing 3 ft .
seas in 20 30 knot westerly winds with the barometer falling .

The storm moved offshore on the evening of 2111968 about 200 miles SSE of the
barge the closest it came and continued towards the WSW .. The seas at the barge
. gradual ly increased to a maximum ot 8 10 ft. from north west and north on the
2211968 . Maximum heave pitch and roll were 3 ft. 4 degrees and 6 degrees
respectively .

Conditions then slowly moderated and operations were restarted at 0600 hours on .
2411968 . Drilling was resumed at 1600 hours .

Drilling was continued to 10166 feet at which depth two conss of a bit were left
in the hole . The hole was then found to be undergauge below 10125 feet and while
reaming the bit became wedged at 10150 feet .

Working pipe and spotting diesel with pipe lax failed to free the bit . The pipe
was backed off at the safety joint and hydraulic jars were run . On the second

run of the jars the bit was worked free .

Schlumberger surveys were taken and at the end of the week a bit was being run
prior to drilling ahead .

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK :

Field activity on the part of the oil exploration industry in
the Ashmore Reef area of the Sahul Shelf began in 1963 with the
conduct of a reconnaissance aeromagnetic survey by Aero Service
Limited on behalf of Woodside ( Lakes Entrance ) Oil Co. N.L . Profile
lines run in the Ashmore Reef area consisted of a northwest line to

the reef a northeast line to Hibernia Reef and a southeast line
back shoreward to Cartier Reef . With hindsigktit is interesting to
Note that these broad reconnaissance data yielded a depth estimate
to magnetic basement of 7000 feet at a point immediately north of
Ashmore Reef . However with the indications of thick sedimentary
section yielded by the following described seismic surveys these
loosely controlled data were considered unreliable .

Initial seismic investigations of the general Ashmore Reef area
were undertaken in 1964 by B.O.C . of Australia Limited Operator for
the Group tenement holders . Included in the seismic survey which was
shot by Western Geophysical Company of America but interpreted by
Seismograph Services Limited of London were a suite of reflection
lines around Scott and Seringapatam Reefs and a northeastern trending
steplike pattern of eastwest and northsouth lines which passed
south and east of Ashmore Reef .

In 1965 the Montobel loMermaid Shoal seismic survey included
additlonal reflection selsmic south cast and north of Ashmore Reef .
These data indicated for the first time the presence of a sizeable
structure associated with Ashmore Reef .

i
i


Therefore the 1966 RankinTroubadour seismic survey included
lines which boxed in Ashmore Reef and which served to del ineate the
size orientation and magnitude of the eastwest longitudional ly
faulted Ashmore Reef anticline .

In early 1967 the Ashmore Reef shallow water marine seismic
survey was specifically undertaken to investigate the geographic
relationship between the anticlinal apex and the lagoon and islands
of the reef as well as to confirm the magnitude of southwestern
closure on the structure . As a result of this survey it was confirmed i
that the apex of the structure lay to the northeast of the reef proper i
and the islands are at considerably lower structural elevations on the
south and southwest flanks of the structure .

STRATIGRAPHY

The ages assigned the various stratigraphic units penetrated at
Ashmore Reef are based on palynological studies by B.E . Balme and on
palaeontological studies by P.J . Coleman both of the University of
Western Australia Perth and on micropalaeontologi cal studies by Dr .
D.J . Belford of the Bureau of Mineral Resources Canberra .

Informal stratigraphical names are put forward for three Tertiary
Upper Cretaceous units and for the Upper Jurassic volcanic sequence . F
This has been done after discussion with Dr. N.H. Fisher Secretary of 7

the Stratigraphic Nomenclature Committee of the Geological Society
of Australia and in consideration of the following factors which
suggest the desirability and the validity of considering these units
as formational divisions :
a ) The TertiaryUpper Cretaceous sequence is the most
palaeontologically complete known to date in the IndoPacific region
. and therefore significant as a type section .
b ) The chosen unit boundaries coincide with seismic reflections
which are mappable over a wide area of the Sahul Shelf . Less tangible
is the high degree of seismic record character continuity over intervals
representative of the units proposed .
While the terminology has been discussed with the appropriate
authorities the following names are considered as unpublished and
therefore have no standing these should not be used in a publication
without definition and the approval of the Divisional Stratigraphic
Nomenclature Subcommittee . i

. ( 28183062 ) . The base of the unit is lithologically gradational as

The details of these units are given in an appendix ( Geology )
to this section of the report and are set out graphically on the
composite log of Plate 4 .

QuaternaryP iocene

Unnamed carbonates ( seabed1053 )

The QuaternaryPl iocene sediments can be subdivided into two
lithologic units . An upper white foraminiferal limestone with minor
lamellibranchs and coral fragments persists from the sea floor ( 160
feet subdatum ) to 540 feet ( 380 feet thick ) . These beds exhibit good
intergranular porosity loss of circulation was experienced in the
interval 400495 feet and the same lithology is there assumed . Between
540 feet and 1053 feet ( 513 feet thick ) a white to cream very fine to
fine grained calcarenite which is poorly sorted and consists of angular
calcareous fragments is the major lithology with minor crystal line
limestone interbeds .

The basal contact is well marked on the induction electric log
by a marked increase in resistivity and on the compensated formation
density log by a sharp increase in density . Palaeontologicaliy the
contact is bracketted by possible Pliocene beds in the lower portion
of the interval 6001000 feet ( from cuttings analysis ) and by a
probable late Lower but possibly early Middle Miocene age assignment
for core No.1 at 1125 feet . The contact is therefore unconformable
with QuaternaryPliocene beds resting on Miocene beds .

Late Middle to early Lower Miocene
Unnamed carbonates ( 10532635 )

This interval may be subdivided into two lithological units an
upper 329 feet ( 10531382 ) of white to cream foraminiferal limestone
with minor interbeds of greyish green calcareous mudstone and a lower
1253 feet ( 13822635 ) of white to light brown very finely crystalline
partly dolomitic limestone in which foraminiferal content increases
downwards .

The basal contact of these unnamed beds is well marked on the
induction electric log by a marked decrease in resistivity and on the
sonic log by an increase in interval transit time . The base of these
beds is coincident with a disconformable seismic event . Palaeontologically
the lower contact is bracketted by a Lower Miocene age assignment to a
cores No.2 ( 228623101 ) and No.3 ( 26192632 ! ) and by an early Lower !

. Miocene ( Aquitanian or Tertiary upper e ) assignment to core No.4

( 29012928 ) . Therefore the basal contact is believed to represent
an intraLower Miocene disconformity . :

Early Lower Miocene

Unnamed beds ( 26353062 )

This unnamed 427 foot interval is characterized by the first down
wards appearance of calcilutite as interbeds in a cryptocrystalline and

foraminiferal limestone ( to 2818 ) or a mariy foraminiferal limestone

evidenced by the marly nature of the foraminiferal limestones . It is
marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in resistivity on

the sonic log by an increase in interval transit time and on the
formation density log by a marked decrease in density . Seismically
this interval is apparently confined to a local area at Ashmore
Reef . Elsewhere it is truncated by a postearly Lower Miocene
unconformity late Lower Miocene or younger beds rest directly

on the Oligocene Cartier beds .

Oligocene
Cartier beds ! ( 3062 ! 4009 )

The Cartier beds are a gradational and interbedded sequence
ot marl and shale . Mari is the sole lithology to 3413 feet ( 351

teet thick ) where shale interbeds first appear and become dominant

downwards to 3648 feet ( 235 feet thick ) . Shale is the sole lithology
from 3648 feet to 3887 feet ( 239 feet thick ) where mari reappears and
becomes dominant to the base of the Cartier beds ! at 4009 feet ( 122
feet thick ) .

The basal contact of the Cartier beds is lithological ly
abrupt and marked on the wireline logs by a marked increase in
S.P . a marked decrease in interval transit time and decrease in
both gamma radiation and density . .

Palaeontologically Coleman has bracketted the upper contact with
an early Lower Miocene age assignment to a sidewall core at 3045 feet
and an Oligocene age assignment of a sidewall core at 3065 . Concerning
the age of the lower portion of this sequence Coleman has assigned an
Oligocene age to core No.7 ( 36223645 ) and an Upper Eocene age to
: core No.8 ( 404014063 ) from just below the basal contact . Therefore
the Cartier beds ! are considered entirely Ol igocene in age with the
possibility that the basal disconformity represents a part of the
Lower Oligocene .

Upper EoceneLower Paleocene
Hibernia beds ! ( 400916543 ! )

The Hibernia beds ! are a thick ( 2534 feet ) gradational series of
several carbonate rock types . Calcarenite prevails to 4209 feet and
remains dominant with minor interbeds of calcilutite to 4484 feet where
calcilutite prevails through to 4760 feet . Calcarenite briefly reappears
between 4760 feet and 4783 feet . The interval between 4783 and 5556
feet is an interbedded sequence of calcilutite and calcisiltite with
the calcisiltite gradational ly becoming dominant downwards . Between
5556 feet and 5730 feet calcisiltite is the sole lithologic component .
Calcilutite is the dominant lithology between 5730 feet and 6177 feet
but with minor interbeds of calcarenite and shale . Micro to crypto
crystalline limestone is the dominant lithology between 6177 feet and
6543 feet but calcilutite interbeds persist downwards to about 6250
feet . The limestone becomes gradational to marl near the base . Chert
nodules and irregular thin bands are present throughout the Hibernia

beds .

Due to ie gradational nature of the composite rock types it is
not felt meaningful to subdivide the Hibernia beds ! into lithological
units . The basal contact although somewhat gradational is fairly wel !
marked lithologically by the first prominent appearance of marl . The
contact is marked on the induction electric log by a decrease in both
S.P . and resistivity and on the sonic log by an increase in interval
transit time . The basal contact coincides with a strong mappable seismic

Eocene or Upper Paleocene age and core No.13 an Upper Paleocene age . Coleman

in contrast has nominated a Middle to Lower Paleocene age for the interval
represented by these cores based on his tentative identifications of
several early Globorotalia species .

The formation is regarded as ranging in age through the Eocene and
part of the Paleocene .

Upper Cretaceous
Woodbine beds ! ( 6543 ! 7956 ! )

The Woodbine beds are a further gradational series of three basic
carbonate lithologies . Although the sequence is gradational it may be
useful ! to consider the following subdivision units :

65436857 ! ( 314 feet ) Marl light green to dark grey about 555
calcareous slightly glauconitic with
interbeds of white to cream microcrystal line
limestone . Calcareous shale at 67326739
feet .

68577007 ( 150 feet ) Limestone essentially as above with
Marl interbeds below 6980 feet .

70077440 ! ( 433 feet ) Calcilutite and Mari

Calcilutite white to light brown litho
graphic grades into light grey light
green and dark grey marl 65505
calcareous argillaceous pyritic
chloritic . Marl is dominant in the
interval 7188 feet to 7273 feet .

74407688 ! ( 248 feet ) Limestone light brown to brown micro
crystalline variable minor ferruginous
or manganese material abundant limonite
styolites throughout and ironrich chert
nodules towards base .


grading downwards to calcilutite 3654
calcareous below 7835 feet .

The base of the Woodbine beds is easily recognised ithological iy
by the abrupt change to shales below . Theinduction electric log exhibits
a downwards decrease in resistivity while the gammasonic shows an
increase in gamma radiation and an increase in interval transit time .

The gradational relationship of the lithology of the upper portion
of the Woodbine beds to the overlying Hibernia beds has already been
discussed . Also the difficulties in nominating a stage within the
Paleocene for basal Hibernia beds has been pointed out . Within the
Woodbine beds Coleman initially assigned an Upper Cretaceous age to
core No.14 ( 67306748 ! ) based on thin section identifications . ( He
had been unable to recover free specimens from digested samples ) .

Beiford however was successful in obtaining free specimens and as

a result nominated an Upper Paleocene age . Coleman has since seen some

ot Belfords material and ( verbal communication ) concurs in a Paleocene

age assignment . Core No.15 ( 72527267 ) has been assigned a Maestrichtlan
age by both workers whereas Core No.16 ( 75757590 ) is regarded as
Maestrichtian by Coleman and as Santonian or Campanian by Belford . Sidewall
core from 7891 feet and cuttings between 7700 and 7950 feet were analysed
without firm results . Coleman however does suggest that the interval
represents the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous and possibly part of the
Lower Cretaceous as well . In the absence of firm palaeontological evidence
the writer would prefer to regard the Woodbine beds as being Paleocene
through Upper Cretaceous with no Lower Cretaceous present .

The base of the Woodbine beds ! coincides with a regional ly mappable
seismic disconformity . :

White the subdivision of the conformable and gradational sequence of
EocenePaleocene carbonates into two formations the Hibernia beds !
above and Woodbine beds below has been recommended on the basis of
the regional mappability of the boundary by seismic means it is to be
emphasized that the succession is conformable and comprises several cycles
of carbonate sedimentation .

Upper Jurassic
Unnamed sediments ( 79568102 )

The interval 7956 feet to 8031 feet consists of dark grey to black
slightly to noncaicareous shale with very fine mica minor pyrite and
glauconite minor fossils and with current bedding . The underlying
23 foet ( 80318054 ! ) consists of Iithic sandstone groen to grey
medlum grained domInantly argil laceous with gralns of opaque volcanics
and rare quartz fresh feldspar fossillferous with a green highly glauconitic
matrix . The basal unit of this unnamed sedimentary sequence consists of
48 feet ( 80548102 ) of light brown to greenish grey calcarenite
containing subangular to subrounded dark greenish grey volcanic fragments
and subangular hard calcite fragments in a cryptocrystal line matrix

. slightly fossiliferous rarely ferruginous .

Core No.17 ( 80168023 ) from near the base of the shale Interval
yielded no useful macro or microfossils . However Balme recovered spores
and pollen which are not chronologically significant but are suggestive
of a Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age . The microplankton similarly are
not accurately definitive but the genus Scrinrodinium is apparently typical
of the Upper Jurassic although a species occurs in the Lower Cretaceous of
Western Australia . On balance Balme considers the assemblage is late
Jurassic although an early Cretaceous age is not out of the question .

Considering that this unnamed sedimentary sequence contains clastic
material derived from the underlying volcanic sequence and considering also
the relative ages of these sediments and the underlying volcanics it is
probable that these sequences are essentlatly conformable .

wWbj 1141m
Ashmore volcanic beds ! ( 81029143 )

The informally named Ashmore volcanic beds ! may be subdivided into
two units :

81028172 Altered amygdaloidal basalt dark grey with
phenocrysts of pyroxene and probably feldspar in

a matrix of iron oxides including haematite and
altered feldspar . Irregular aggregates are a
mixture of green chlorite calcite and a zeoite
and resemble amygdales .

intervals .

Samples from core No.18 ( 82818290 ! ) were radiometrically dated by
the potasslumargon method by Dr. lan McDougall of the Research School
of Physical Sciences Department of Geophysics and Geochemistry at the
Australian National University Canberra . He reports an age based on
duplicate measurements of 137.3 4 3 million years . The age obtained
can be regarded as a minimum value owing to the deuteric alteration
in the rock some diffusive loss of radiogenic argon may have occurred
so that the true age may be a few percent older .

The presence of numerous tuffaceous interbeds attests to several
distinct volcanic flows . These individual flows may have been separated

by several days or several million years . Accordingly samples of core

No.19 from 8841.5 teet and 8842.5 feet were submitted to Dr. McDougall
in an attempt to determine if an appreclable portion of Jurassic time
is represented by the volcanic sequence . The two samples yielded
comparable dates at 129.4 4 3.0 million years which is regarded as

a reliable minimum age . Tlaarly these samples have leaked more argon
than those from the higher core . This may be due to a greater degree
of alteration andor to the greater depth and attendant higher temperatures
that core No.19 samples have experienced . Dr. McDougall concludes that
the volcanic sequence was erupted during one main volcanic episode of
relatively short duration ( say several million years ) . The writer
concludes that it is unlikely that preTithonian Jurassic beds are
present at Ashmore Reef The Ashmore volcanic beds are unconformably

: underlain by Upper Triassic beds according to Balmes age assignment of

core No.20 ( 92959317 ) .

Upper Triassic
Upper unnamed Upper Triassic Clastics ( 914311980 )

This interval of the well contains a diversity of interbedded and
gradational predominantly clastic rock types . Sandstone grades from
rarely silty though malnly fine to medium grained but occasional ly
conglomeratic Is subangular to subrounded and has carbonaceous micac ous
and argillaceous bands and Shale interbeds with similar composition ar
found between 9143 feet to 9674 feet . These beds are noticeably non
calcareous and are taken to represent a paralic environment

Similarly composed but slightly calcareous siltstones sandstones
and shales are dominant from 9674 feet to 9953 feet ( 261 feet thick ) .
An occurrence of slightly quartzose calcilutite at 9742 feet to 9753
feet represents the uppermost occurrence of carbonate in the Upper
Triassic sequence . The overall Interval is slightly more marine in
aspect than the overlying .

The balance of the clastic sequ nc to 11524 feet has the sam
accessorles and is described as only slightiy calcareous . Limestone
interb ds are pr sent . The sequ nc is regarded as paralic .

The shale between 11524 feet and 11657 feet ( 133 feet ) is
up to 504 calcareous and regarded as a normal epineritic marine
deposit . The clastics from 1165711980 feet are again relatively
sparse in carbonate and are regarded as parallc .

Balme has variously described cores Nos.2025 from this interval
as probably Upper Triassic consistent with Upper Triassic and
not likely older than Middle Triassic . On balance he considers the
sequence at least down to 10583 feet to be Upper Triassic . At
11024 feet ( core No.24 ) Coleman has identified Costatoria suggestive
of an Upper Triassic age .

Unnamed Upper Trlassic Carbonates ( 1198012703 )

This interval consists of cryptocrystal line imestone with minor
interbeds of slightly calcareous fossiliferous shale . These ithologles
are indicative of shallow quiet water marine environment . Above 12148
feet the upwards appearance of 33 feet of noncalcareous siltstone
interbeds of slightiy quartzose shale and the argillaceous and quartzose
nature of the limestone itself attest to the early influx of clastic
material to the previously low energy environment .

From core No.27 ( 1242312433 ) Coleman has identified a mol luscan
fauna similar to an Upper Triassic assembiage found in Indonesia . The
gradational nature of the upper and lower contacts attest to the conformity
of the sequence and suggest the continuance of an Upper Triassic age to

total depth .

Lower Unnamed Upper Triassic Clastics ( 1270312843 ) ( T.D . )

These beds are the oldest penetrated by Ashmore Reef No.1 . Therefore
it can not be stated whether the interbedded calcareous siltstone and
sandstone with cryptocrystalline limestone and slightly calcareous shale
represent a minor clastic influx into a quiet shallow water marine environ
ment or the closing phase of a much more extensive older clastic sequence .

Table 1 shows the regional age relationships between the section
penetrated at Ashmore Reef and rock units in the Carnarvon Basin and on

Portugese Timor .

STRUCTURE

Through the interval of unnamed early Middle to late Lower Miocene
sediments between 1053 feet and 2635 feet the Schlumberger dipmeter
recorded dips ranging from 0 ? to 470 The average dip of the observations
is 13.7 ? whereas the median observation Is 122 The median azimuth of
dip ( for 569 observations ) Is 0799 . From seismic it is now recogni sed
that the underlying early Lower Miocene through Palaeocene rock sequence
is regionally thick and therefore Ashmore Reef was situated in a regional
low during these stages . It is interpreted that the upl 1ft required to
form the present day Ashmore Reef seismic structure began during the late
Lowerearly Middle Miocene and the relatively high observed dips are due
at least in.part to primary sedimentary dip on syntectonic clastic beds .
It Is possible however that in these semiconsol idated sediments the
dipmeter is recording spurlous data and the higher magnitude dips are not

present .

The early Lower Miocene interval of 2635 feet to 3062 feet
exhibits a dipmeter baseline of dip of 2030 with downwards decreasing
or increasing dip patterns up to a maximum dip of 202 . The true
structural dip is interpreted as 223 ? to the ENE . Downwards
increasing dip patterns may be indicative of minor normal faults at
2662 feet 2735 feet and 2756 feet .

Other dip patterns are interpreted as due to primary sedimentary
dip .

Similarly the Ol igocene maris from 3062 feet to 4009 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip of between 0 ? and 22 . Numerous
downwards increasing or decreasing patterns of greater dip are most
likely due to differential compaction of these plastic sediments .
Small normal faults also attrIbutable to this cause also may be
present .

The EocenePalaeocene carbonates of the interval 40096543 feet
exhibit a dipmeter baseline of dip which increases downwards from 2 ?
to 50 . Numerous increasing or decreasing downwards patterns of dip
are interpreted as indicative of primary sedimentary dip although
minor normal faults may result in some of the increasing downwards
patterns . Rose diagram plots of dip azimuths suggest dip to 2790 in
the upper part . of the sequence changing to 319 ? towards the base .

The Cretaceous sequence of maris and limestones from 6543 feet
to 7956 feet exhibits a pronounced dipmeter baseline of dip of 9 ?
down ko 6740 feet and of 122 ? from there to the base . As before
the numerous greater dips observed fall into patterns Interpreted as

.due to primary sedimentary dip . One possible exception Is the pattern

ot increasing dips ( to 90 ) which terminates abruptly at 7226 feet
this could indicate a minor normal fault at that depth . Median
azimuth of baseline dips is 143 ?

The thin sequence of uppermost Jurassic sediments which unconformably

underile the Upper Cretaceous sequence in the interval 7956 feet to

8102 feet exhibit a baseline of dip of 1222 on the dipmeter . Patterns

of greater dip ( up to 100 ) are attributed to primary sedimentary dip .
Median dip azimuth is 93 ? . The Ashmore volcanic beds between 8102

feet and 9143 feet as would be expected exhibit a somewhat variable
baseline of dip of from 12 to 67 . Numerous greater dips are interpreted

as due to irregular lava flow contacts . Median azimuth of dip is to the

sw .

The unnamed Upper Triassic clastic sequence from 9143 feet to
11980 feet exhibits a baseline of dip between 3 and 10 ? with extremely
numerous patterns of greater dip ( up to 240 ) indicative of primary
sedimentary dip . Median azimuth of both the baseline of dip and of
# he sedimentary dip patterns is southeast . The Upper Triassic carbonates
between 11980 feet and 12703 feet have a baseline of dip at 12 to # ? .
Median azimuth of these dip observations is 2450 Numerous patterns of
greater dip are interpreted as due to primary dip these have a median
azimuth of 140 ? . The deepest Upper Triassic beds drilled between 12703
feet and 12843 feet exhibit a baseline of dip between 12 and 5 ? with a
median dip azimuth of 520 Greater dips are interpreted of sedimentary
origin median azimuth of these Is 1130


-----Page 120-----

10 .

The dipmeter results agree with the observations of dip in
recovered cores ( see Table of Observed Dips ) . The low magnitude of
dips and varlability of dip azimuth throughout the Lower Miocene to
Upper Cretaceous rock units suggests that the well was located very
near the apex of the Ashmore Reef anticline . Jurassic beds have a
slightly steeper structural dip ( 8 62 ) as do those of the Upper
Triassic clastics ( 2107 ) respective southwesterly and southeasterly
median azimuths of dip apply . 1t therefore could be argued that the
well is consierably downdip in a southerly direction from the
structural apex in rocks of these ages . However due to the presence
of the major downtothenorth northeasterly trending normal fauit
located approximately 1 mile north of the well it is unlikely that
a significant area of higher structural elevation is present .

before and after drilling .

RELEVANCE TO OCCURRENCE OF PETROLEUM

Hydrocarbon Shows

No signs of liquid hydrocarbon were observed in the Ashmore Reef
No.1 well .

The only indications of gas from the mud analyser were of a very
minor nature and occurred while drilling the Upper Jurassic Ashmore

@ mamapa maa

volcanic beds especially from the upper interval of altered amygdalol dal
basalt . Between 8152 feet and 8174 feet percentages of 1.35 methane and
0.0468 ethane were recorded . Intermittent shows of methane up to 0.475
persisted to a depth of 8885 feet . Thereafter trip gas containing up to
18 methane and nitrogen was observed during drilling to total depth . The
magnitude of these gas indications was insufficient to warrant testing
which was not recommended .

Porosity and Permeabi li ty

intervals of good porosity and permeability were encountered in the
Quaternary early Middle to late Lower Miocene early Lower Miocene
EocenePaleocene and Upper Triassic rock sequences .

Porosity logs were not run on the Quaternary foraminiferal Imeston
and calcarenite above 978 feet . However these posed continuing lost
circulation problems during drilling and are presumably highly porous
and permeable . Between 978 and 1053 feet these beds have logindicated
porosities of 31325 .

The early Middle to late Lower Miocene log porosities between 1053
and 2635 feet vary from 22 to 355 ( see log interpretation for greater
detail ) . Core No.2 from 2286 feet to 2310 feet revealed similar
porosities of 21 to 358 with permeabilities of between 15 and 1134
millidarcies . Core No.3 of the interval 2619 to 2644 feet analysed
between 19 and 245 porosity and 0.96 to 5.44 millidarcies .

The Eocene calcarenites of the Hibernia beds in the interval
4009 to 4484 feet exhibit sonic log porosities of between 20275
porosity and average 238 . Core No.8 of the interval 40364063 feet

Sandstones in the Upper Triassic mixed clastic sequence in the
interval 9143 to 11980 feet have porosities varylng between 20 and
94 as revealed by log analysis . In a general way sandstones near
the top of the interval tend to be more porous and permeable than
those below . The following ranges of porosities and permeabi llties

Igneous Activity

The occurrence of Upper Jurassic volcanics in the interval 8102
feet to 9143 feet is only detrimental to petroleum prospects in this
and older age sediments insofar that associated volcanic necks and
presumably present assoclated dykes and sills may have broken up any
preexisting oil migration pattern . Although the corresponding seismic
interval of high energy dies out rapidly at Ashmore Reef this does not
preclude the reglonal presence of additional volcanic sequences in the
Sahul Shelf area .

CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

Virtuaily every aspect of geologic Information from as remote a
stratigraphlc test as Ashmore Reef No is of importance . The most
significant contributions to geological knowledge are :

( a ) The thick ( 5321 foot ) interval of Lower Miocene through
Upper Cretaceous sequence of terrigenouspoor sediment
is palaeontological ly paraconformable and regarded by
palaeontologists as possibly the most complete in a time
rock sense yet revealed in the IndoPacific region .
Nevertheless sharp lithological boundaries and possible
faunal gaps tend to support the selsmic record sectlon
evidence of unconformabledisconformable relationships
of the Oligocene Cartier beds marls to the underlying
EocenePaleocene Hibernia beds ! . Furthermore the
seismic interval isochron map of the Tertiary portion
of this paraconformable sequence suggests Ashmore Reef
to be in a depositional synclinal position during
those times within the general Sahul Shelf area .

( b ) The uplift which produced the Ashmore Reef anticlinal
structure was postearly Middle Miocene In age .

( c ) The apparent absence of Lower Cretaceous sediments or
appreciable Jurassic sediments sets the Ashmore Reef
area apart from either Timor or the Carnarvon Basin .
Due to the angular unconformity on seismic records at
the base of the Uppermost Jurassic volcanics this
uplifting phase of the area probably occurred in pre
late Jurassic but postlate Triassic times . The area
remained above wave base ( except for a minor phase at
the close of Jurassic ) until Upper Cretac ous times .

The presence of the thick incompletely drilled sequence
of Upper Trlassic beds is problematical because of
their clastic character and southeasterly sedimentary
dip . Thus a clastic source area must be Invoked in the
area northwest of Ashmore Reef . However the Ladinian
through Norian Aitutu formation In Portugese Timor
comprises 804 calcilutite 158 shales and only 52
calcarenites quartz arenites and radiolarites . Thus
the postulated landmass northwest of Ashmore did not
contribute significant amounts of clastic material to
Portugese Timor .

The presence of Upper Jurassic vocanics are not
serlously detrimental to petroleum prospects In older
beds . The areal distribution of these volcanics on
the Sahul Shelf is unknown .

Rocks at Ashmore Reef No.l which were found porous and
hence are.regionally potential reservoir rocks on the
Sahul Shelf are the upper calcarenite facies of the
Hibernia beds ! and the upper portion of the unnamed
Upper Triassic clastic sequence . The porous Miocene
beds could be prospective In other parts of the Sahul
Shelf if these can be found beneath an effective cap
rock .

The Gamma Ray tool failed to function which was unfortunate as a direct shale
reading would have been useful . Ei

The interval 1168985 feet is badly washed out in bands and quantitative
interpretation in this interval is difficult . The interval 11682635 feet

is remarkably close to gauge and is suitable for quantitative work . The

interval 26353650 is more shaly and the hole averages about 13 inches
diameter . A slight drift on the S.P . is present but most of the magnetism
seen on Run No.1 has been removed .

ks

Il . NOTES
( a ) Rw

There is no S.P . deflection throughout most of the logged interval
indicating that Rw and Rmf are very close . The calculated
formation water salinity is in the order of 30000 ppm NaC .

Two zones immediately below 2635 feet give moderately high salinity
and below this depth a marked positive shitt in the S.P . base line
occurs .

( b ) Rt

The induction curve which approximates Rt is generally less than
4 ohm but shows thin peaks up to 4.5 ohms over tight zones .

( Cc ) Porosity

Porosities as determined from Formation Density are generally
lower than those derived from the Sonic Log due to shaliness .
and possibly due to lack of consolidation . A slight decrease
in sonic transit time on the Sonic Log between 1380 ft. and
2635 ft. suggests increased compaction while on the Formation
H Density Log a marked decrease in average bulk density suggests
a marked increase in compaction .

Sidewal ! Cores as specified in Appendix

The 958 casing shoe was located at 8140 ft. and the bottom of the
83 hole was logged at 10171 ft .

The memoriser of the conductivity curve failed during the Induction
Electric Survey and a rerun was made . During the SonicGamma Ray
Caliper Survey a hydraulic pressure leak caused the tension to slack
off in the Rucker Compensating System and resulted in unacceptable
errors in the depth scale of the Schlumberger logs . After repairs to .
the hydraulic system the survey was rerun .

The survoys wore Initially Intondod for consolldatlon purposes but
examination of the .E.S . suggested certain lithological anomalies .
To resolve these problems the Formation Density Log and sidewall cores .
were added to the programme . After taking 17 cores a fault in the
electrical circuits terminated the operation and remaining cores will
be taken during the next surveys .

Below the 958 shoe down to 9138 feet the hole is washed out to
an average diameter of 11 inches . Below 9138 feet the hole condition
is better having an average size of 9 inches with maxima and minima
of 934 inch and 85 inches respectively .

The following interval velocities were calculated from the integrated
sonic log .

Thickness TravelTime Velocity

JInterval ( fr . ) Ft. ) ( msec . ) ( ft.sec )

The surveys revealed firstly that the interbedded volcanics logged : in
drill cuttings below 9400 feet are not present and secondly that . U
areanaceous beds extend upwards to at least 9143 feet .

The interval between 9143 feet and 8950 feet can not be shale because k
of its low radioactivity and is probably weather basalt or tuff but ) v
final definition must await confirmatory sidewall cores during the
next log run .

The foilowing general subdivisions are tentatively proposed :

Unit A 8140 8950 Volcanics definitely
8950 9143 Volcanics possibly tuft .

Unit B 9143 9675 Sandstone massive very fine grained
( SandShale Ratio 1:0.61 )

unit C 9675 10170 Siltstones with massive beds very fine
grained sandstone and occasional bands
calcilutite . ( SandShale ratio 1:1.9 )

The cavings from the volcanics present below the 958 casing have :
badiy contaminated the underiying succession to an extent not
realised while drilling . While drilling the extremely fine grained
sandstones were broken up and the grains passed completely through
the screens . Normally this would have been recorded .in the flow line
mud sample but with the high mud volumes and slow penetration rate
the sand quantities did not rise above 15 .

G ) The logged interval is entirely water bearing . The salinity
of the water is approximately 85000 ppm .

( ii ) Three lithostratigraphic units are suggested although final
definition must await further sidewall cores . It is certain
that there are no interbedded voicanics below 9400 feet and
it is very probable that volcanics are absent below 9143 feet .

N.t CONCLUSONS

The logged interval is entirely water bearing . The salinity of the

NaCl in the range 12750 12768 feet . Sidewall cores confirmed that : th

. FORMATION TEST

The formation test at 9230 feet recovered 10750 ccs of mud filtrate
and 2250 ces of mixture of 10 135 formation water and 90 879 mud
filtrate . The components of the mixture are estimated from the .
salinities of the sample mud filtrate and the formation water . The
salinity of the formation water is derived from the SP curve .

Maximum formation pressure measured was 4120 p.s.i .

Permeability was calculated to be 2.75 mds . This very low figure is
presumably caused by mudding of the formation adjacent to the

borehole . It is very likely that if a conventional production test
was conducted the formation would be cleaned up and a more reasonable
permeability would be indicated .

12200 feet and 50000 ppm

base of volcanilcs is at 9143 feet .

VELOCITY SURVEY

ASHMORE REEF NO. ! WELL
by
B.O.C . OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED

Introduction

. B.O.C . of Australia Limited contracted Western Geophysical Company
of America to perform the velocity survey . Under the contract Western
agreed to furnish the following :

Two Gulftype Model GCE101 Pressure Sensitive Well Geophones
One Amplitfier case including 12 S.I.E . P11l Amplifier channels
One Amplifier case including 2 Water Break Amplifiers

One S .. E. PRO11 Camera with 12 gal vanometer elements

Two battery type blasters

Two Kaar TR327 radios ( Citizens Band type )

One portable developing system

Necessary power supplies cabling etc .

In addition Western furnished one observer and one shooter . The
survey was conducted on the 23rd and 24th of March 1968 at times
convenient for the well operation .

Survey Procedures

The survey was conducted in very calm weather and at the Neap Tide
period when the tidal variations of the water level were very small . .

1 . Shot Positioning

The shots were fired to the northeast and southwest of the well .
A reference geophone was lowered 25 teet below the water in the moonpool
of the rig and was used to record the water break . The distances that

shots were fired from the well were calculated from the water break times .

2 . Explosives

Fifty pound charges of Dupont Nitromon WW were used for ali well
geophone stations . The majority of shot to well distances were between
1500 and 2000 feet .

3 . Well Geophone Positioni ng

All depth measurements were made using the Schlumberger depth
indicator and compensat ions were made for the tidal variations of the
sea .

The following procedure was used to keep the geophone stationary
in the bore hole when the shots were fired : the marine riser was
disconnected from the derrick tfioor and lowered to the casing top
the Schlumberger cable was clamped with a Tbar device and the cable
was lowered until the Tbar rested on top of the marine riser .

Instrumentation

The seismic instruments were set up behind the Schlumberger unit
on the port side of the upper deck on the Investigator . The location
permitted good communication with Schlumberger and the derrick floor .
Eight traces were utilised on the survey records . Traces 1 through 4
monitored the well geophone at four different gain levels . Traces 5
and 6 monitored the well reference geophone in the moonpool . The time
break was recorded on trace 7 . Trace 8 was used for the 100 cycle
timing checker trace . On the amplitfiers receiving signals from the
well geophone wide band filtering and fixedgain recording mode were

-----Page 147-----

2

used throughout the survey . : .The master gain levels were varied betw n
shots in anticipation of the signal strengths to b recorded . Signals
from the well reference geophone in the moonpool were passed through the
.two specially designed water break amplitiers .

.Resulis

. Shots were fired with the well geophone stationed at sixteen differ nt
levels ranging from 1360 to 12710 feet below the Mean Low Water Spring
tide datum . Check shots from opposing . sides of the well were obtained at
five different levels .

The results of the velocity survey have been shown on the attach d :
computation sheet and graph . The record quality varied from good fo
questionable the majority being fair . Adequate check shots were obtain d
: to yleld a reliable survey .

. Conclusions a o

( 1 ) The velocity survey will provide identification for the seismic
reflection horizons recorded in the vicinity of the well .

( 2 ) The velocity survey data comparable to the integrated Sonic Log data .
show fairly good overall agreement . .t is felt that where the Sonic Logs .
are of good quality a limited number of check shots with the gecphon a
stationed at intervals In excess of 2000 feet would be sufficient to
: provide absolute times to tie the Integrated Sonic data .

DESCRIPTION

LIMESTONE white to cream fragments vary
from fine to very coarse minor fossil
fragments mainly foraminifera good inter
granular and vugular porosity .

Two types are
present with both grading into each other .

( 1 ) White to cream composed of cream
caicareous clastics ( 1 mm . to maximum of
2 cms . ) and foraminifera ( 405 of rock ) as
well as minor fragments of light grey to
light blue calcareous clastics . All are
set in a light brown to cream calcareous
cement which contains significant numbers
of small well formed calcite or dolomite
crystals . Good intergranular and vugular
porosity is present throughout . Semi
consol idated .

( 2 ) Light brown composed of up to 608
forams generally white minor black ones .
Porosity is fair to poor and mostly
vugular . Harder than type ( 1 ) . No
petroleum indications .

CALCILUTITE light grey to light brown
crossed horizontal ly by large numbers of
white and dark grey calcareous streaks .
Fossils ( 304 foraminifera ) generally lie
parallel to colour bands . Approximately

405 of the rock is cream calcareous clastics
set in a light grey to light brown cement or
matrix poor vugular porosity interbedded
with Coquinite light and dark grey hard
well compacted grading into the calcilutite .
Foraminifera are present with the two large
torams dominant . ( One is biconvex and tends
to distort the other disc shaped type . The
latter is dominant and has distinct concentric
ornament . Increasing numbers of a black
biconvex foram are present towards the base .
Porosity poor . 1t is probable that there is
little to no dip .

CALCILUTITE : white to light grey generally
clay sized with the white zones rich in silt
sized calcite grains . From 2907 to 2912 ft .
and 2916 to 2923 ft. there are large numbers
of very thin disc shaped foramini fera with
their long axes mainly parallel and extending
across core . Often they are present in
clusters and are then randomly orientated .

In areas between the abovementioned bands
very fine fossils are present . No obvious
Dip is probably horizontal .

. SHALE : grey fissile silty in part argilla

ceous slightly micaceous and up to 258
calcareous with very fine unidentifiable
fossil fragments as well as minor foraminifera
often replaced by pyrite . Towards the base
areas of light grey fragments of micro
crystalline limestone occur up to 2 across
generally partly rounded with a sharp contact
with the surrounding Shale . These are probably
clastics and are much harder than the Shale .
The fissility would indicate probably zero
dip . No indication of hydrocarbons .

CALCARENITE : white to light brown granular
with equal amounts of silt sized very fine
grained and fine grained calcareous clastics
slightly dolomitic and fossiliferous with thin
bands rich in elongated fragments possibly

fossil remains good to fair intergranular

porosity .

A possible break in deposition occurs at 40596
where there is a sharp break downwards from
white to light blue calcareous material . This
grades back to the white to light brown type by

.40606 . Above this disconformity are very

thin laminations of black possibly carbonaceous
and or ferruginous material which are primary
bedding structures . Secondary structures or
Styolites are present throughout . All styolites
show only minor irregularity i.e . they do not
appear as a wriggly trace but as a straight or
curved line .

Dip : Nil strong odour of HS when core is
broken .

CALCILUTITE : white to cream microcrystal line
almost entirely calcareous with fossils common

: throughout . Porosity is fair to poor and is

probably intergranular and vugular . Most vugs
seen are associated with fossils . Chemical
structures including nodules and styolites

are present throughout . Nodules composed
entirely of Chert are found in the top six

feet of the core . They vary from 5 to 4
across . They have a regular outline but are
often branching . Styolites are rare and poorly
developed . Towards the base zones enriched
with glauconite or chlorite are present . The
basal and most outstanding zone has a sharp
upper contact with the base grading back into
the Calcilutite . Large amounts of . pyrite often
in cubes are present in this zone which extends
across most of the core .

Fossils include Pelecypods Foramini fera and
Crustacea . No apparent dip strong sulphide
odour when core is broken . .

CALCILUTITE : cream to light brown micro
crystalline or microgranular almost entirely
calcareous minor pyrite throughout general ly
in cube form fossils absent . Porosity is

poor and where present is a result of
tracturing . This is particularly apparent

at the base of the core where there is a
slickenslide coated with clear crystals of
dolomite . Throughout.the core but more
concentrated in the top foot are laminations
slightly darker than the surrounding material

still very caicareous and probably due to
increasing amounts of carbonaceous or argilla
ceous material . These are completely irregular

and change shape and direction consi derably .
Also present throughout are well developed

styolites .

Dip : probably horizontal with a strong

. sulphide odour when core is broken .

CALCILUTITE : light buff grey dense tough
composed essentially of calcareous mud

probably mainly of clastic rather than chemical
origin small fraction of quartzose silt non
calcareous clay and silt sized grains of a black
mineral dispersed through the rock calcareous
cement : irregular bands and patches of very

fine grained Calcarenite ( a slightly coarser
version of the Calcilutite ) and of small streaks
of dark grey and black carbonaceous material
indicate a lack of dip or very low dip . Light
bluish grey nodules of Chert with offwhite
haloes and irregular to rounded shapes commonly
less than an inch across are scattered through
out the core the nodules which are only slightly
calcaroous are of secondary origin . The core Is
intersected by many irregular fractures whIch
commonly dips at high angles : fracture planes
show developed slickensides which impari a
styolitic appearance fracture planes are

lined with fine calcite crystals and a dark
carbonaceous material . lIntergranular porosity
is very poor .

LIMESTONE : mottled light greenishgrey massive
tight microcrystal line with scattered lathlike
aggregates ( mainly less than 4 long ) of very
finely crystalline pyrite and other dark minerals :
the laths are surrounded by very light green
limestone ( suggesting secondary origin ? replace
ment of organic matter ) which gives the rock a
faint mottling the laths are elongate both
normal and parallel to the length of the core .
Very thin wavy and subhorizontal laminae of

dark Shale appear noticeably at about 6024 teet
the laminae become more obvious downwards and

at 6025.5 feet several Shale laminae in a zone
about 1 thick are present . The SHALE is firm
to hard fissile calcareous and slightly pyritic
silty carbonaceous and micaceous . The Limestone
grades downwards into CALCILUTITE which is semi
crystalline . in the upper part only . It grades
from very light greenishgrey to creamybuff

it consists of calcareous mud and silt ( partly
recrystallised in the upper part ) bound into a
firm rock with calcareous cement quartzose

silt and noncalcareous clay form about 10205

of the rock siltsized grains of pyrite and a

black mineral are scattered through the rock .

Several zones up to 4 thick of wavy
laminations and streaks of dark Shale are
present the zones are commonly associated
with welldeveloped styolites . The
calcilutite shows several smallscale
sedimentational structures including load
casts convolutions and flame structures
shaly laminae are depressed below and arched
over pillowlike structures which appear to
be loadcasts the sedimentational structures
give the rock a faint mottling . Several ight
grey rounded CHERT nodules about an inch
across are present in the calcilutite one
nodule has a styolitic boundary with the host
rock and shaly laminae are arched over it .

At about 6037 feet several dark bluish patches
with irreguiar outl ines consist in part of

: crystals of calcite and very finely crystal line

pyrite with rims highly concentrated in pyrite
the origin of the bluish colour is unknown .
Irregular fractures intersect the calcilutite

at high angles the fractures are lined with
calcite in places . The shaly laminae indicate
negligible dip . Very poor intergranular porosity
is probably present in the noncrystal l ine
calcilutite .

Fracture porosity is also present .

LIMESTONE : with minor thin beds enriched with
argi llaceous material .
Limestone white to cream made up mainly of

clay or smaller than clay sized particles with

large amounts of microcrystalline calcite and

up to 206 argillaceous material slightly

pyritic associated with a black metallic like
mineral very minor carbonaceous material and
clear angular quartz grains . Porosity is poor

to nil and due entirely to fractures . Approxi
mately vertical fractures often less than j
apart are present throughout . Brecciated zones
associated with these are also present . Crystals
of calcite are often present along these fractures .
Evidence of faulting in the form of a pronounced
slickenside surface is present at 6524 . This
runs at an angle of 40 degrees and has a coating
of argillaceous material . Running parallel with
this are a number of minor fractures . The Lime
stone is compact dnd hard . Argillaceous rich
bands up to 3 thick are present throughout with
an upper gradational surface with the Limestone
and generally a sharp lower boundary . Thin
argil laceous and possibly carbonaceous lamel lae
are present with no less than 654 calcareous
material . These lamellae can be extremely thin
and irregular in shape and extent . They indicate
a possible dip of up to 10 degrees .

CALCILUTITE white to cream entirely clay sized
hard with 904 calcareous material minor pyrite
and quartz rare glauconite and fossils . Porosi ty
is poor to nil . Two Styolites are present both
approximately 4 thick and both made up of partly
calcareous argillaceous and phosphatic material .
No fracturing is present in this interval .

CALCAREQOUS SHALE grey to green with all
particles clay sized fissile slightly
glauconitic and pyritic up to 258 calcareous
material . All pieces disintegrate readily .
Dark streaks bearing no relation to the
bedding are present throughout . These have
a greater calcareous content than the
surrounding material . 1t is possible that
some of glauconite present has replaced the
original forams . There is a sharp break
with the overlying calcilutite which is
probably a disconformity only .

MARL grey entirely clay sized fissile with
less glauconite than previous interval minor
pyrite with up to 508 calcareous material . It
is also harder and does not disintegrate as
readily as the previous interval . Slickenside
surfaces indicating minor faulting is present
in both argi laceous intervals .

MARL grading into thin beds of CALCILUTITE .

MARL : light and dark grey grading from equally
calcareous and argil laceous to 755 calcareous
fissile pyritic with large grains of pyrite up

to an inch in diameter also replacing or
infilling fossils minor amounts of flaky
elongated chiorite . This is probably chamosite
and replaces compressed fossil remains .
individual beds or laminae of marl with the

same calcareous content are generally thin

i.e . the core is composed of a large number of
thin grey and dark grey areas with the dark
greyareas containing increased amounts of
argillaceous material . Boundaries are grada
tional . lrregularly shaped darker areas are
also common and were probably pockets of more
argillaceous o0zes . Often these are composed

of predominantly silt sized material . Unidentifi
able fossil . remains and foraminifera are present
throughout .

CALCILUTITE : white to light grey probably rarely
crystalline composed almost entirely of clay
sized material approximately 808 calcareous
with most of the remainder argillaceous partly
pyritic with fossils common also containing
darker irregular bodies of more argi laceous
material as present in the Marl . The upper
boundaries of the Calcilutite beds ( range up to
6 thick ) are quite often sharp while there is
always a gradation of the lower boundary into a
Mari .

A zone of Marl at 7260 ! indicates a dip of
approx . 23 degrees as well as minor compaction
before the deposition of the overlying rock .

The water current appears to have eroded this
surface forming a microintraformational breccia
above the darker Mari .

LIMESTONE light brown to brown tending to a

pinkish brown in part massive microcrystal line
compact but not hard almost entirely calcareous
with varying but small amounts of ferrugi nous
material throughout numerous fossil fragments

throughout with few recognizable . Forams

are present ( Globotruncana ) . AJ4i fossils

are present as dark brown calcareous outl ines
infilled with the microcrystal line groundmass .
This groundmass contains numerous dark brown
calcite . fragments which vary from 0.5mm down
to approx . the same size as the surrounding
material .

Styolites are present throughout particularly
in the darker zones in which there can be up
to four per foot . They vary in thickness
from very thin traces up to 3 thick and are
composed entirely of limonite . Any colour
changes in the Limestone occurs across these
styolites . On rare occasions crystals of

dfibrous calcite also occur in the styolites .

Vertical fractures are common and offen only
3 apart . A fault plane is present at the

base of the core associated with minor

brecciation as well as fibrous calcite

recrystallization along the fault plane . A

slickenside surface is also associated with
this fault .

Porosity is poor and never exceeds 105 . 1t
is probably due entirely to fractures .

SHALE : dark grey to black hard massive when
fresh but fissile when dry occasional shell
fragments and crinoids otherwise only very
slightly calcareous or noncalcareous very
fine mica flakes throughout rare pods of
pyrite glauconitic current bedded .

BASALT : black composed predominantly of black

and green phenocrysts of pyroxene and olivine

set in a black pyroxene and felspathic ground
mass . No other minerals including quartz appear
to be present . The core is completely homogenous
except for an irregularly shaped zone of chlorite
and calcite approx . 3 thick at 8285 ! and a Im
thick darker and finer grained bed of volcanic
material at the base of the core . Surrounding
this irregular vein of chlorite and calcite the
Fock has been altered to a light brown colour .
The alteration extends no more than 3 into the
volcanic material .

The dark band at the base of the core would
indicate that the dip does not exceed 5 degrees .

WEATHERED BASALT : dark grey hard but containing
large numbers . of very thin hairlike fractures
mostiy filled with a light bluegreen mineral
also contains quite large numbers of irregularly
shaped vesicles and amygdales of calcite . All
tend to be elongated at approx . 45 degrees to
the axis of the core . The groundmass is black
and contains numerous grains of a black mineral
rarely greater than mm . across . These tend
to be lineated in approx . the same direction

as the elongated amygdales mentioned above .

The fractures are probably due to movement of
the lava just prior to solidification .

BASALT dark grey very hard only slightly
weathered with the composition almost identical
to top interval rare vesicles with the ones

present still containing calcite . Sl ickenside

Fluorescence : brown organic remains in both

The Sandstone and the Shale exhibit a dull

gold fluorescence with a strong bluish white
cut . Although the Sandstone does not exhibit
any f # luorescence it gives a light green solvent
# luorescence . Ncither types of fluorescence
effect the colour of the solvent .

The solvent with the carbonaceous remains was a
very pale yellow but this was probably due to
the carbonaceous material not the fluorescing
material .

The fluorescent solvent was left to stand with

a piece of absorbent paper immersed in it .

This had two indistinct rings . The lower.one is

There is a poorly defined graduation between the

PETROLOGY AND PETROGRAPHY
OF

SELECTED ROCKS

FOR

ASHMORE REEF WELL No.1

BY

J.E . GLOVER


-----Page 186-----

.

The rocks selected for discussion fall naturally into three groups .
Thes are

CO ) the sedimentary rocks from 7950 8085 feet inclusive
( 2 ) # he volcanic rocks from 8106 8841.5 feet inclusive and
B3 ) the sedimentary rocks from 9295 9316 feet Inclusive .

The petrographic descriptions of these rocks are followed by a brief
discussion of their petrology and speculation on some of the events
to their formation .

A report on Cores 25 and 26. as well as cuttings from the intervals
11830 11840 ! and 11930 11940 ! is also included . :

CUTTINGS 9750 7960 feet .

Handspecimen

The cuttings include light grey dark grey and brown very fine
gralned rock fragments and a few muscovite flakes .

Thin section

Gralns included in the thin section range from foraminiferal
argi llaceous calcilutite to foramini feral calcareous claystone .

SIDEWALL CORE 39 7967 foot .

Handspecimen

The material in this specimen consists of friable pale grey and grey
green fragments in which it is difficult to distinguish any texture
with the hand lens .

Thin section

The fragments are made up of sedimentary rock particles . One particle
is a foraminiferal calcarenite containing a little siltsized quartz
rare brown fragments of possible collophane and a sand grain of basalt .
Another particle consists of silty glauconitic foraminiferal
calcareous claystone .

CUTTINGS 8020 8030 feet .

PAA AA an

Handspec imen

The specimen consists of cuttings of grey sedimentary rock .

Thin section

These cuttings contain fragments of finegrained dolomite and three
other sedimentary rock types which are gradational . These are
foraminiferal calcilutite foraminiferal claystone and silty
foraminiferal glauconitic claystone containing a litti pyrit .


-----Page 187-----

8045 feet .

SIDEWALL CORE 38

Handspec men

The rock is greygreen very friable and is composed mainly of dark
grey and greygreen sand grains . It effervesces locally In . cold
dilute hydrochloric acid .

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone in which most of the grains range between

0.12 0.50 mn . are angular to subangular and are opaque . The

opaque grains are either black or dark .grey to redbrown In reflected
light . Although the origin of these grains can not be determined beyond
doubt the presence of some dark grains of undoubted basaltic origin
suggests a volcanic derivation for all of them . The clearly basaltic
.grains contain abundant minute feldspar laths with intergranular

iron oxide grains and a little secondary chlorite . Other material in the
rock includes silisized quartz glauconite argillaceous material a
little calcite and rare fragments which seem to be phosphatic

material of organic origin . The rock isa silty fine to medium grain d
argi laceous glauconitic lithic sandstone containing grains of basalt .

8050 feet . U

SIDEWALL CORE 37

Handspecimen

The rock is friable and greygreen and is made up mainly of sand
sized grains of greygreen and brown minerals . There is faint
effervescence in cold dilute hydrochloric acid .

Thin section

The rock is a sandstone containing varied debris including abundant
subangular to subrounded grains of volcanic rock . One volcanic

.grain is composed mainly of almost colourless glass containing a few
laths of feldspar and a little chlorite . Most grains are darker and
many have an intergranular groundmass with opaque iron oxide filling
# he interstices between minute feldspar laths . Ferromagnesian
minerals including phenocrysts seem to have been present but are
altered beyond recognition . Chlorite is a common secondary mineral
in the volcanic grains . Many of the grains are hemihyal ine and contain
minute laths of feldspar in grey brown and dark brown glass . Brown
scoriaceous material sometimes spoken of as threadlace scoria or
reticulite is particulariy common as angular to subangular fragments .
The vesicles in this scoria are generally filled with glauconite which
is also common as discrete sandsized pellets . ( Other sandsized grains
in the rock include labrodorite and andesinefel dspar quartz and very
rare analcitenepheline fragments . The grains range mainly between
0.25 0.50 mm in diameter and are cemented locally by calcite and
by an argil laceous matrix . Some of the opaque iron oxide of the
voicanic grains has a redbrown stain in reflected light despite the

Thin section

The rock Is porphyritic with highly altered phenocrysts up to one
millimetre long in a groundmass of opaque iron oxldes and
minute altered teldspar laths . The larger phenocrysts were feldspars
and have been converted to a mixture of calcite green chlorite and a
colourless mineral probably a zeolite . Some of the chlorite is
brownish apparently due to iron staining but there is another brown
to brownishgreen mineral with slightly higher birefringence which may
be a clay mineral . No feldspar is sufficiently unaltered for precise
determination . Some of the smaller phenocrysts are shaped like olivine
but are also completely altered mainly to green chlorite but partly
to a brown mineral . The opaque iron oxides of the groundmass include
Iimenite leucoxene and some haematite .

Some minerals in the slide are unusually shaped and have either filled
.vesicles or replaced the rock in irregular fashion . These minerals
consist of calcite and analcite but there Is also a less common
flaring mineral of low birefringence and low relleft which may be a
zeolite . Many patches of these minerals have a rim of ironstained

mineral perhaps a clay mineral . :

The specimen from sidewall core 33 8109 feet is similar mineral

minerals as analcite was confirmed by Xray powder pattern methods .

are also scattered abundantiy through the rock .

Thin section

This rock is mineralogically a Ilttle different from the specimens
of Core 18 in that 1t contains fewer phenocrysts of augite and
feldspar . 1t is porphyritic with chloritized and carbonated
phenocrysts having the characteristic shape of olivine in a ground
mass which ranges from intergranular with aligned plagioclase laths
and granules of purplishbrown pyroxene and black iron oxide to the
less common intersertal texture in which the plagioclase laths are
separated mainly by chlorite . Most of the phenocrysts lie between
0.1 0.6 mn . in length and they are generally altered to a pale
.green rim of chlorite with a calcite core . Calcite and chlorite also
form veins in the rock and a few irregulariy shaped masses of calcite
with chiorite rims resemble amygdales but their nature is uncertain .
There are also some green patches which resemble chlorite but seem to be
completely isotropic .

Phenocrysts of titaniferous augite and plagloclase are rare and small .
Most of the laths of plagioclase in the groundmass range from 0.1
0.2 mm . in length and their composition is apparentiy mainly In the
andesine range . Colourless rods with oblique extinction are too small
for determination but seem to be augite .

This rock is a chloritized and carbonated ol ivine basalt in which all
olivine has been replaced and it resembles rocks from 8839 feet and
88411 feet in Core 19 in having abundant altered olivine phenocrysts .
However in the last two mentioned rocks the alteration products of the
olivine crystals are generally different . A few are changed to a green
chlorite and some are partly changed to calcite but most are changed to
green or yellowgreen fibrous to finely divided material with moderately
high birefringence . The slight apparently gradational variations in
colour and texture of this material make it possible that either two
minerals or one mineral with a range of . properties are present .
Patches of a green mineral resembl ing chlorite but seemingly isotropic
like volcanic glass have also been observed in these rocks .

It is difficult in view of the range of green and yellow green

minerals in this rock to obtain a pure separation of one mineral . An

Xray powder pattern photograph of green material separated from one of

# he rocks is somewhat blurred and not conclusive . The dominant pattern
resembles nontronite but does not correspond precisely with known

patterns of that mineral . To sum up most of the olivine in the rocks

from 8839 feet and 88415 feet has altered to material that is clos

to nontronite in many of its properties and some of the olivine has altered

to chlorite and calcite .

PETROLOGY
( 1 ) SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BETWEEN 79508085 FEET

The specimens include cuttings and sidewall cores . There is a
diversity of sedimentary rock types including very fine grained
foraminiferal calcareous and argillaceous sediments . Sandsized
particles of volcanic origin tend to become more important with
Increaslng depth . Some of these grains may have had a tuffaceous
origin but the appearance of most of the volcanic sand grains Is
consistent with their having been derived by erosion from
extrusive rocks like those encountered deeper in the section .

( 2 ) . VOLCANIC ROCKS BETWEEN 81068841.5 FEET

The materlal studiod includes four sidewall cores ( core 34 8106 feet h
core 33 B109 feet core 32 8154 feet and core 31 BI6O feet ) one
specimen of cuttings ( 81608170 feet ) and : six core specimens ( core 18

8281 feet 8286 feet 8290 feet core 19 8835 feet 8839 feet 8891.5 ft . )

The rocks in sidewall cores 34 33 and 32 are altered analcite bearing
rocks for which the tentative names of analcite basanite and analcite
tephrite have been suggested . These rocks also contain some haematite
suggestive of their having been affected by weathering .

Volcanic rocks in sidewall core 31 and cores 18 and 19 are fresher and
their feldspar is better preserved which greatly assists in their
classification . None of the rocks contains olivine but the shape of
many of the altered phenocrysts . resembles olivine and suggests that all
the volcanic rocks so far encountered can be assigned to the alkaline
olivinebasalt suite . Altered phenocrysts of the supposed olivin are
more common in core 19 than In rocks of core 18 above but no reason

is advanced for this at this stage .

( 3 ) SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BETWEEN 92959316 FEET

. These rocks consist mainly of quartz sandstones with intercalations of
dark claystones and they are lithologically distinct from the sedimentary
rocks above the volcanic rocks . Most of the sandstones have undergone
some diagenetic silification but no evidgnce of tuffaceous contribution
has been observed . Final assessment of the environment of deposition

of this sequence must awalt comprehensive and detailed evaluation of

their combined lithological palaeontological and palynological
characteristics but what is at present known of them is not inconsistent
with a deltaic origin .

SPECULATION

The succession lends itself to speculation which closer sampling and

more detailed work may well modify . It is not unreasonable at this stage
however to suppose that flows were extruded on a land surface underlain
by sediments of deltaic origin . At least three flows may be represented
all derived from an alkaline olivine basalt magma . The upper or analcite
bearing rocks of the volcanic section the most highly differentiated
Focks seem to have been partly oxidized by exposure . The area may have
sunk partly as a result of the adjustment that caused the extrusions in
the first place . Alternatively the flows may have issued from faults
which were active during the subsidence . Earlyformed sedimentary rocks
received extensive contributions due to the erosion of exposed volcanic
rocks and perhaps also because of the expulsion of tuffaceous material
but these contributions lessened and eventually ceased with further
depression of the area .

is cut by veins of a white to pale brown locally coarsegrained mineral .
Effervescence in cold dilute hydrochloric acid is rather patchy .

Thin section ma

The rock is made up of two main components . One component ranges
from silty claystone to argi laceous siltstone and contains abundant
pyrite and carbonaceous materlal . Most of the argil laceous material
1s brown and finely divided but there are patches and veins of a weli
crystallized mineral of the kaolinite group . This mineral Is described
separately below . The other main component of the rock is carbonate . A
little carbonate is present in the claystone and siltstone but most of
it is segregated in veins . Some of it develops as rhombshaped grains
which do not stain or stain patchily to turquoise in acid solution of
alizarin red S and potassium ferricyanide . Other carbonate stains deep
blue or locally purple . Grains studied in oils show a wide range of
refractive indices and W in some grains attains 1.71 . The unstained
carbonate is dolomite the turquoise carbonate is ferroan dolomite and
the remaining carbonate is calcite .

The patches and veins of the well crystallized mineral of the
kaolinite group are dark grey in handspecimen where they easily escape
observation . Some of the veins have been partly replaced by carbonate .
The mineral is colourless has pronounced cleavage oblique extinction and
Is optfIcally positive with a moderately sized optic axlal angle . The
optics indicate that the mineral is dicklte and an Xray powder pattern
Is consistent with this view . Dickite is not normally a mineral of
sedimentary origin but is generally hydrothermal . It can be reasonably
suggested that the veins of this mineral were caused by hydrothermal
activity connected with the volcanism responsible for the extrusive rocks
higher in the sequence . If so however .the temperatures Involved wer
low for high temperatures would have destroyed plant microfossi Is .

The wide range in composition of this rock prevents its being given

PALAEONTOLOGICAL REPORT ON SAMPLES FROM

ASHMORE REEF NO.1 WELL

NTRODUCT ION :

This report is a summary of palaeontological results obtained from
samples yielded by Ashmore Reef No . Well located on the edge of the
continental shelf northwestern Australia . The samples came mostly
from cores numbered 1 tto 27 supplemented by 21 sidewall samples and
33 ditch cuttings .

By and large the succession revealed by these samples is a relatively
complete one ranging from Quaternary to Upper Triassic the Jurassic
alone being absent palaeontologically . Importantly the lower Tertiary
appears to be complete and in general Ashmore Reef No.1 Wall offers
what may prove to be a standard stratigraphic column for this most
important and hitherto unknown region .

in quantity . :

From 600 to 1000 feet there aro only scattered foraminifera In a dolomitised
biomicrite . The foraminifera are altered but the same genera and species
appear to be present . It is possible nevertheless that the deeper part
of this interval is of Pliocene age but there is no worthwhile Pl iocene
section . The environment of deposition would seem to be as it is now an
atoll although the intense dolomitisation poses a problem in this environ
ment to which there is no sure answer as yet .

2 . 1125 to 2928 feet Cores 1 through 4 plus selected sidewall samples
and cuttings .

The faunas yielded by these cores range in age from late Lower Miocene ( the
youngest ) to early Lower Miocene . To 2300 feet approximately the fauna
includes Lepidocyc ! ina WTrybliolepedina ) radiata ( Martin ) Lepidocycl ina
CTrybliolepidina ) sp cf . L. epigona Schubert L. ( Nephrolepidina )
verrucosa scheffen Miogypsina polymorpha ( Rutten ) Miogypsina sp . Gypsina

globula ( Reuss ) Sporadotrema spp . and Operculina complanata ( Defrance ) .
This is a Miocene assemblage probably late Lower Miocene but possibly early

Middie Miocene . The sediment is still a wellwashed foramini feral calcarenite .
Below 2300 feet L. sumatrensis ( Brady ) and Miogypsina cushmani indonesiensis
Tan become dominant with a species of Cycloclypeus similar to C. indopacificus

Tan . Algae fragments are now common . AT 2600 feet the large Eulepidina

badjirraensis Crespin appears and at 2900 feet is the most dominant constituent

in the sediment although Cycloclypeus is common together with Heterostegina
borneensis van der Vierk indicating a depth of accumulation exceeding 100 m

This lowest assemblage is early Miocene in age that is approximately
Aquitanian or Tertiary upper e. There is no change until about 3050 feet .

3 . 3050 to 4000 feet Sidewall samples plus Core 7 .

A change in lithology is marked by the presence of more silt and clay abundant
fine quartz and both benthonic and planktonic foraminifera . Large foraminifera
are absent . There is a restricted fauna of planktonics with species in common

with warmwater Oligocene Pacific faunas ( Todd 1966 ) . Species present

include Globigerina sellii ( Borsetti ) and G. tripartita tapuriensis
Banner and Blow .

There are also patchy occurrences of ostracodes which in this type of
sediment suggest a shallow water environment . The ostracode genera

include Trachyleberidea Cl ithrocytheridea and ? Alatocythere which on

past experience are not found in sediments younger than Oligocene . In

Core 7 there is an unusual occurrence a normalsized fauna together

with a replicate fauna of socalled dwarfs which suggests an especially
favourable living environment . This part of the well is of special academic
interest because it may weli offer a complete grading without hiatus from
the Upper Eocene ( see below ) and similarly passing into the early Miocene
above 3030 feet .

4 4000 to 4700 feet Cores 8 9 and sidewall sample .

Most of this interval is Upper Eocene both Core 8 and 9 containing species

ot Discocylina and Aktinocyclina with Asterocycl ina mantanzensis Cole
especially common . Both small benthonic and planktonic foraminifera are

well represented . There is some glauconite and scatterings of dolomite
crystals . As has been the case throughout this succession so far there
is little terrigenous sediment . The evidence continues to favour as an
environment of deposition the notion of an offshore crown or bank with
free access to openocean waters .

4 . 4700 to 6020 feet Cores 10 and 11 sidewall samples and cuttings .

The faunal content drops rapidly although there is still abundant organic
calcite most of it in the form of macerated tesis in general terms the
sediment is a dolomitised foraminiferal calcilutite . The few benthonic

and planktonic foraminifera could not be extracted for identification . The
log position and apparent absence of an hiatus suggests a Middle Eocene
through Upper Paleocene age for this interval .

5 . 6020 to 6700 feet Cores 12 and 13 sidewall samples .

Planktonic foraminifera are more common and include several species of

early Globorotalia . Positive specific identification was not possible

but G. sp . cf . G. aequa Cushman and Renz and G. sp . cf . G. acutispira Bolli
are very tentatively identified in Core 12 a sidewall sample at 6196 and
G. sp . cf . uncinata Boilli in Core 13 . It may well be that this is a Middle
Lower Paleocene section .

6 . 6730 to 6748 feet Core 14 .

Globotruncana appears in this core marking the uppermost Cretaceous the
species is not identified positively but is referred to G. citae Bolli :

G. sp . cf . G. lugeoni . Tilev may also be present . Both these referals

it shouid be noted are based on thinsection study . Core 14 was dis
aggregated only with difficulty and no diagnostic species could be identified .

TI . 7000 to 7690 feet Cores 15 and 16 sidewall samples .

Over this interval the sediment is a pelagic o0ze with carbonaceous material
and a little marine manganese and pyrite . The fauna is a Globotruncanarich
Senonian ( Maestrichtian ) one dominated by G. tricarinata that is G .
lapparenti ( or Iinneiana ) tricarinata ( Quereau ) and including G. conica
Cushman .

8 . 7700 to 7950 feet Sidewall samples and cuttings .

Over this interval Globotruncana is replaced by a sparse fauna of small
globiqerinaceans in a calcilutite matrix which may also contain shell
fragments e.g . at 7795 feet . Hedbergella is identified tentatively between
7850 and 7950 feet . No firm age can be assigned to this interval but it is
likely that at least the remainder of the Upper Cretaceous is present and
possibly part of the Lower Cretaceous as well .


-----Page 204-----

9 . 7960 to 8220 feet Core 17 and sidewall samples and cuttings .

This interval is marked by a sudden increase in quartz the appearance of
repeated bands of coarse shell fragments ( echinoderms molluscs bryozoans )
and below approximately 8090 feet stained and probably weathered lava
fragments .

10 . 8281 to 9143 feet Cores 18 and 19 .

The basalt yielded by these cores is part of a volcanic sequence with
unusual petrological features ( Company report by JE . Glover ) .

Uu . 9143 to 11000 feet Cores 20 21 22 and 23 sidewall samples and
cuttings .

The sediment over this interval is primarily a micaceous carbonaceous
quartz arenite usually fine grained but with many coarse and also silty
layers extensively reworked and with greatly varying amounts of calcite .
There are no determinable fossils although occasional scattered fragments
of pelecypods echinderm plates foraminifera and ostracodes show that much
of this interval is marine . ln general the evidence suggests a deltaic
environment despite the lack of foresets and other positive delta criteria .

12 . 11000 to 12000 feet Cores 24 25 and 25 .

With Core 24 at 11024 feet there is no great change in lithology but

Cpelecypod fragments become especially common . They include some identified

as the genus Costatoria suggestive of Upper Triassic age . The sediment is
extensively cleaved and fractured and over the remainder of the interval is
only poorly fossil iferous .

K

13 . 12000 to 12843 feet ( completion Cores 26 and 27 sidewall samples
below 12433 feet .

Although quartz is still prominent in the sediment calcite is the predominant
mineral most of it in the matrix for fossils are still quite rare and
confined to thin bands . The recognizable fauna is mol luscan although ostra
codes are common but not extractable . In Core 27 the dominant sediment is

a calcarenite with microcoquinoidal bands and with scattered whole fossils .
The organic content may be up to 804 . The fossils identified include Misolia
sp . Nucula sp . cf . N. misolensis Jaworski and ? Myophoria sp . These and
similar species occur in Indonesia ( Krumbeck 1913 1925 1924 ) and suggest

an Upper Triassic age for the containing sediment . The same sediment occurs
in sidewall samples to 12843 feet the completion depth of the well . Quartz
is stili a significant part of the sediment but the last 850 feet suggest
# hat Ashmore Reef Well No. ! entered more nearly normal shallow water sediments
marginally if at all deltaic and still of Upper Triassic age .

MICROFLORAL LISTS
Core 4 : 29012928 fi .

Dicotyledonous pollen grains possibly assignable to the Casuarinaceae
occurred sparingly and a single specimen of a podocarpaceous conifer pollen
grain was identified .

Dinoflagel lates were fairly common but the suite was poorly diversified
and consisted of about four species of spinose forms belonging to the genera
Hystrichosphaera and Achomosphaera . None of these is known to have a closely
restricted range elsewhere and the most that can be inferred from the
palynological evidence is that the sample is Upper Cretaceous or Tertiary .

NOGO Ni

Core 7 : 36223645 ft .

Plant microfossils were more common in this sample than in either of .
the other two cores examined . They included pollen grains and spores
fungal teleutospores dinoflagellates and acritarchs . The forms identified
were as follows :

Spores and pollen grains :
Cyathidites sp .

cf . Osmundacidites sp .

Iricolporites sp .

Myrteaceidites sp .

Nothofagacidites sp . ( N. brassitype )
Iriorites cf . harrisi ( Couper )
Podocarpidites sp .

aff . Chenopodium sp .

Dinoflagel lates :

Hystrichosphaera sp .
Achomosphaera cf . ramulifera ( Def landre )
Baltisphaeridi um ( Cleistosphaeridium ) sp .
Hystrichosphaeridlum spp .
Acritarchs :
Micrhystridium spp .
Leiosphaeridium spp .
An estimate of the frequency of each of the main groups in one

gram of sediment based on counts of representative samples gave the
following results :

Spores 13gm
Angiosperm pollen 343gm
Dinof lagel lates 1286gm
Fungi 502gm
Acritarchs 3940gm
Gymnosperm pol len 13gm .

Age : The core is dated as Oligocene from foraminiferal evidence
and the palynological data are consistent with this estimate although
in themselves not chronologically critical . In southern Australia
. Nothofagacidites appears to be most common in late Eocene to early Miocene
sediments although its complete known range is late Cretaceous to Recent .
All the other spore and pollen species range throughout the Cainozoic in
Australia with the exception of the form recorded as aff . Chenopodium sp .
This is represented by only two specimens however and the possibility
that these are modern contaminants can not be excluded .

Although pollen grains are 5parse in the slides their frequency is
fairly high for this type of sediment . Concentrations of over 300gm
suggest that the sediment was laid down fairly close to land . It is
perhaps noteworthy however that all the angiosperm pollen species are
small forms which are likely to have been widely distributed by currents .
Not much published data exists on the distribution of dinoflagellates in
modern marine sediments but investigations in the Gulf of Mexico ( Traverse
and Ginsburg 1966 ) indicate that they are most abundant in shallow some
what offshore marine environments .

Core 8 : 40364063 feet
The total yield of plant microfossils from this sample was lower than
that from Core 4 or Core 7 . This is likely to be controlled by the lithology

of the sediment rather than any notable change in environment of deposition .
Forms id ntitfied are listed below :

Spores and pollen :

Comments :

The assemblage is too poorly diversitied to enable the sediment
to be dated more precisely than late Cretaceous or Tertiary . It differs
in no obvious fundamental way from that occurring in Core 7 allowing
for the greater diversity of angiosperm pollen grains in the higher core .

Core 15 : 72527267 fi .

Although its content of acidinsoluble microfossils was low the
sample yielded a fairly diverse suite of dinoflagel lates and acritarchs
much more so than any of the assemblages from cores higher in the well .

Spores and pol len grains of presumed terrestrial origin were extremely
rare .

Fungal teleutospores occurred occasional ly .

Age : Although many of the forms recorded resemble species previously
identified from Europe and Australia it is not easy to assess their
stratigraphic significance except within broad limits . Odontochitina
operculata is a distinctive species which is common in the Cenomanian in
Australia although its complete range is probably Neocomian to late
Cretaceous .

Many of the species of Hystrichosphaeridium and Hystrichosphaera
resemble forms from the European Senonian and there is no doubt that as a

whole the assemblage has a distinct ! y Upper Cretaceous aspect . However
documentation of the stratigraphic ranges of dinoflagellate species is
still at a rudimentary stage and it would be premature to base firm bio
stratigraphic conclusions on a single assemblage from a geographical ly
isolated area .

Environment of deposition

Marine with little evidence of terrestrially derived organic material .
Quartz grains of presumably clastic origin are however fairly plentiful in
the residue .

Core 17 : 80168023 fi .

Dinoflagellates acritarchs and plant tissue were abundant in the

Scriniodinium sp . cf . S. attadalense Cookson 4 Eisenack


-----Page 212-----

Age : This assemblage is quite different in the abundance of plant
microfossils from any recovered from cores higher in the well . Its
composition is also unusual and distinct from the assemblage listed from
Core 15 .

The spore and pollen species are of no critical chronological
signiticance although the presence of Classopollis torosus suggests a
Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age .

The microplankton recorded resembled forms known to be widely
distributed in late Jurassic and early Cretaceous sediments in Australia
and elsewhere . 1t lacks however the species which have been used in
Australia as a zonal indices for that part of the geological column .

A possible exception is Scriniodinium cf . attadalense a Neocomianearly
Aptian form in Australia . Forms normally associated with S. attadalense
( e.g . Dingodinium cerviculum ) were not found in the present assemblage

and this fact together with the slight doubt concerning its identification

makes one cautious about proposing a firm age .

favour a Lower Cretaceous ( Neocomian ) age but can not exclude
the possibility that the sample is late Jurassic i.e . Tithonian in the
rather loose sense in which this Stage name has been used by Australian
microplankton workers .

Environment of deposition : Marine with a low content of terrestrially
derived microfossils .

Core 20 : 92959317 ft .

Spores pollen grains and vascular plant fragments abundant . Rare
spinose acritarchs .

Spores and pol len :

Alisporites sp .

Acritarchs :
Schizosporis sp .
Micrhystridium sp .

Large fragments of cuticle were abundant and some of these showed
c Il outlines of the Dicroidium type . :

Age : Th assemblage is of Triassic age and its gross composition
compares closely with those encountered in Upper Triassic d posits in
Tasmanla South Australia Queensland and New South Wales . In common
with many Australian Triassic assemblages this one is not very diverse


-----Page 213-----

and is dominated by pollen grains of the falcisporites type . These almost
certainly derive from corystosperms a group of Triassic plants which bore
leaves referred to Dicroidium ( z Thinnfeldia of some workers ) .

Upper Triassic strata are not known from surface exposures in Western
Australia although they probably occur in bores at Onslow and Long Island in
the Carnarvon Basin . The associated volcanics in Ashmore Reef may be contem
poraneous with intrusives encountered in Barlee No.1 well in the Canning
Basin although there is a substantial discrepancy in the radiometric ages
attributed to the two suites .

Environment of deposition :

Acritarchs occurring in the siltier lithologies in Core 20 suggest
. marine influences although the bulk of the microfossils and the organic
debris are of terrestrial origin . This suggests.a paralic succession with
alternating nearshoremarine and nonmarine deposits .

Cuttings 96909700 ft .

Abundant semifusinised wood tissues and fibres cuticular fragments
common . Spores and pollen grains fairly rare . Occasional small leiospheres .

Sulcatisporites sp .

Alisporites parvus de Jersey
Falcisporites australis ( de Jersey )

Platysaccus sp . cf . P. queenslandi de Jersey
Age : From the abundance of Falcisporites australis the assemblage is

undoubtediy Triassic . It is not diverse enough to enable a more precise
dating although it is not likely to be older than Middle Triassic .

Environment of deposition : The relative abundance of coarse plant tissues

together with the gross lithology of the core sample suggest a shal low
water environment not far removed from the site of plant growth .

Cuticle fragments of the Dicroidiumtype common .

Age : Probably Upper Triassic . Although the sequence of Triassic
spore assemblages in Australia is not yet known in detail the elements
listed above all occur in Upper Triassic sediments in Queensland and South
Australia ( de Jersey 1962 Playtord 4 Dettmann 1965 ) . In its quantitative
composition the assemblage from Core 21 resembles those from the Ipswich
Coal Measures . 1t has less in common with those from the Mungaroo Beds
in the Carnarvon Basin . These are also probably of Upper Triassic age
but contain species known trom the late Triassic of Madagascar which
have not so far been found in eastern Australia .

pa mna

Environment of deposition : All the plant microfossils identified appear to
derive from vascular plants and the assemblage contains no obviously marine
elements . t is consistent with a nonmarine origin and the sediment is
probably a deltaic swamp accumulation .

Core 22 : 10061 ft .

: Fragments of Dicroidiumtype cuticles together with pieces of thick
.papillate cuticle were also common .

Age : Probably Upper Triassic .

Environment of deposition : No evidence for a marine origin and assemblage
of plant microfossils basically similar to that occurring in Core 21 .

Age : The assemblage is dominated by Falcisporites australis a form
which appears to range throughout the Triassic in Australia but is most
abundant in Middle and Upper Triassic deposits . All the other elements in
the assemblage are consistent with an Upper Triassic age and the association
of Annulispora folliculosa Guthoerl isporites cancellosus Duplexisporites
gyratus and Platysaccus gueenslandi suggests a correlation with part of the
Leigh Creek Coal Measures in South Australia the Ipswich Coal Measures in
Queensland and perhaps the Brady Formation in central Tasmania ( see de
Jersey 1962 Playford and Dettmann 1965 Playford 1965 ) .

Environment of deposition : Probably nonmarine reducing environment from
the abundance of wellpreserved vascular plant fragments and the absence of

spinose acritarchs .

Core 24 : 11033 ft .
Abundant fusinised woody debris . Spores and pollen grains fairly
common but poorly preserved and mostly difficult to identify at specific

commonly . This has a spheroidal test about 4Qu in diameter its surface
divided into rounded polygonal fields ( about 5u in diameter ) by rows of
closely packed fine spines . The form is distinctive and does not fit
easily into any existing form genus of the Acritarcha .

Age : Apart from its content of acritarchs the assemblage does
not differ essentially from that listed from Core 23. t is also Triassic
and probably Upper Triassic in age .
Environment of deposition : The presence of spinose acritarchs suggests
marine influences and the sediment may represent a marine incursion across

lowIying delta swamps . Fragments of land plants are nevertheless dominant
in the assemblage .

Ephedripites sp .
Falcisporites australis ( de Jersey )

Alisporites sp . cf . A. opii Daugherty
Platysaccus queenslandi de Jersey
cf . Fimbriaesporites sp .

Age : The assemblage differs slightly trom those recorded from the
higher Triassic cores particularly in its fairly high content of the costate
pollen grain Ephedripites . This form genus has a long geological range
and although it is common in Upper Triassic sediments elsewhere in the
world no precise stratigraphic significance can be attributed to the species
r presented here . The assemblage is not older than Middle Triassic and the
evidence favours an Upper Triassic age .

Environment of deposition : No evidence of marine organisms and assemblage
similar to those from Triassic sediments higher in the well for whicha

deltaic swamp origin was suggested .

SUMMARY

Plant microfossils were recovered from sixteen samples from Ashmore
Reef No.1 Well . The assemblages described fall into one of four broad
categories :

. Cores 4 7 and 8 yielded sparse assemblages mainly of dino
flag llates but containing occasional spores and dicotyledonous pollen
grains . They are not diverse enough to attempt close dating but are
consistent with a Tertiary ag .


-----Page 219-----

I12

2 . Core 15 ( 725267 ft. ) contained fairly diverse microplankton and
very rare spores and pollen . t is assigned to the Upper Cretaceous .

3 . Core 17 ( 801623 ft. ) was the highest sample to yield abundant
acidinsoluble microfossils . These were mainly acritarchs and dino
flagellates . The association is rather unusual but sugges ? s an upper
most Jurassic or early Cretaceous age .

4 . Samples between 9295 ft. and 12830 ft. contain essentially .
similar assemblages . There is evidence for a minor break between
10583 ft. and 11033 ft. and the lower samples show evidence of marine
influences during deposition . All the assemblages are of Triassic age
and those between 9295 ft. and 10583 ft. are considered to be Upper
Triassic . Below the latter depth the assemblages are insufficiently
diverse and too poorly preserved to enable any attempt at refined dating
but there Is nothing which suggests that they are older than Middle
Triassic and the whole sequence could be Upper Triassic .

Plant tissues were abundant in all the Triassic samples and it
is likely that they were laid down in an environment not far removed
from the site of plant growth . Considering the palynological evidence
and the gross IIthology of the succession a deltaic coastal plain appears

Although plant microfossils were not usually well preserved below
about 9000 feet they were still identitiable at 12830 ft From this
it is concluded that the sediments have not been subjected to tectonism
or affected by igneous activity .

Dear Sir

KAr Dating of Core 19 88358844 feet Ashmore Reef No.1

From the two pieces of core 19 suppliedthin sections were
cut for preliminary examination as to the suitability of the
rocks for dating . In both basalts microphenocrysts of
completely altered olivine ( O . 31 mm in size ) and rare clino
pyroxene phenocrysts occur in a fine grained groundmass ( 0.02
0.2 mm ) consisting of fresh clinopyroxene prisms iron oxide
plagioclase laths ( sometimes altered ) and a considerable amount
of nearly isotropic pobrly crystallized material . In addition
chlorite is present in the groundmass and as veins through the
rocks . In the sample from 88413 feet the amount of plagioclase
is small whereas in 88423 feet plagioclase is abundant and is
aligned to give the rock a fluidal texture . These basalts show
considerable evidence of alteration which however maybe
mainly deuteric . The rocks are similar to that in core 18
examined previously the degree of alteration being comparable .

Because of the fine grain size of the alteration products
together with the higher temperatures at depths of the order of
9000 feet it was realized that some leakage of radiogenic argon
may have occurred since the basalts crystallized . Nevertheless
both samples were processed and the results are given in the
enclosed table . The indicated ages agree to within experimental
error at 129.4 t 3.0 m.y . This is a reliable minimum age and
the results show that both samples have retained radiogenic argon
equally well . However the dates are significantly younger
than that obtained on basalt from core 18 600 feet higher in
the well . Clearly there has been greater leakage of radiogenic
argon from the core 19 samples than from the core 18 basalt .
This may be due to different degrees of alteration andor to
the greater depth and hence higher temperatures that the core 19
basalts have experienced . The amount of loss of radiogenic
argon is impossible to estimate . Because of the petrographic
similarity between the basalts from cores 18 and 19 together
with the comparable ( if reversed ) dates my personal
interpretation is that the basalts were erupted during one main
volcanic episode possibly of relatively short duration ( say
several million years ) .

Because of the demonstration that some leakage of radiogenic
argon has occurred from the basalts these data unfortunately do
not allow an unequivocal interpretation . as to how much of the
Jurassic is represented at Ashmore Reef My opinion is that
there may be an appreciable period of time not represented by
deposition or volcanism .

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Martison

Further to our Phone conversation today I enclose
details of the potassiumargon age results on the basalt core
at 828118290 ! in the Ashmore Reef No.l well .

The thin section we cut of the basalt showed it to
contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and altered olivine ina
fluidal groundmass consisting of plagioclase laths small
prisms of clinopyroxene iron oxide and a distinct poorly
crystallized low birefringent feldspathic ( 7 ) phase together
with considerable chloritic material . The rock is reasonably
fresh and what alteration is present is probably deuteric .

The details of the KAr measurements are given in the
attached table . Both K and Ar were measured in duplicate with
most satisfactory reproducibility . The probable error for the
final calculated age is about # 2.5 per cent . The age obtained
137.3 4 3 m.y . can be regarded as a reliable minimum estimate
for the time of crystallization . Owing to the deuteric
alteration in the rock some diffusive loss of radiogenic argon
may have occurred so that the true age may be a few per cent
older .

On the presently accepted physical time scale ( cf . Quart .
Jour . Geol . Soc . London v.120 S special volume p.260 ) the
indicated age is equivalent to the top of the Jurassic as the
JurassicCretaceous boundary is estimated to lie at an age of
about 136 m.y . Such an age is reasonably consistent with the
palaeontological determination obtained:5ediments 260 ! higher

.up the core and clearly indicates that the basalts are in

conformable sequence with the overlying sediments .

Yours sincerely
