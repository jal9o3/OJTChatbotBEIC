L. SUMMARY

Challis8 was drilled in the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Licence
ACL3 in March 1988 by the semisubmersible Sedco 708 . The well was
located 860m northeast of Challis7 ( Figure 1 ) .

The Challis field is located along the northeastsouthwest trending Cleghon
Horst which is one of the major structural features of the southern ACP4 area

( Figure 2 ) .

It is a faultdependent closure with an areal extent of approximately 9 sq km and
a maximum relief of 85m . Results of the Challis8 well have increased the areal
extent of the field to the northeast and also the vertical relief of the structure in
this area .

The well was drilled to a total depth of 1700m and intersected a 77.5m gross oil

.column from 13611438.5mKB ( 13351412.5mSS ) . Oil pay was present from the

top of the Pollard Formation ( 1392mKB ) which had been intersected below the
oilwater contact in previous Challis wells .

An oilwater contact is recognised in the Pollard sandstones at 1412.5 TVD
subsea . This is 2m lower than the fieldwide oilwater contact recognised at
Challis3 in the C3.0 sand within the Challis Formation .

One 9m core was cut within the Triassic reservoir section . Effective porosities
average 27.496 and permeabilities adjusted to reservoir conditions average
1360md . A production test was carried out over the interval 1393.5 to
1409.5mKB which flowed oil at a maximum rate of 7864 stbday on a 12864
choke .

Two major unconformities at the Base Miocene and Base Cretaceous levels are
recognised in the well while a number of disconformities are present mostly

within the Cretaceous section

Challis8 was suspended for future use as an oil producer .

2l Previous Activity

The Challis Field is located within the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands
Permit ACP4 ( of which the Challis Licence ACL3 is a part ) approximately 650
km west of Darwin and 20 km south of the Jabiru Field in the Timor Sea off the
northwest coast of Australia ( Figure 1 ) .

Permit ACP4 ( originally NTP26 ) was awarded in October 1979 for a six year
term . In March 1986 5090 of the Permit was relinquished and the remainder
renewed until March 1991 . It was during this second Permit term that the
Challis Field Development Plan was conceived and as a consequence the

Licence Area ACL3 was awarded to BHP Petroleum et al for a 21 year period
from January 1988 to January 2009 .

In the nine years of involvement in ACP4 BHP Petroleum has drilled 23 wells
and acquired in excess of 19500 km of seismic ( see Table 1 ) . Moreover three
economic oilfields have been discovered the Jabiru Field in 1983 the Challis
Field in 1984 and the Cassini Field in 1988 . Oil production from the latter two
fields began in December 1989 .

Prior to Challis8 seven wells had been drilled on the Challis structure and two
wells had been drilled on the nearby Cassini structure .

Challis1 spudded in October 1984 was suspended as an oil discovery in
November 1984 having encountered a gross bydrocarbon column of 29m with
21m of net oil pay in Triassic sandstones . Production testing resulted in oil flows
up to 6730 stbday with a GOR of 326 scfbbl .

Challis2 was spudded in January 1986 at a location 1.6km east of Challis1 .
After encountering severe hole problems the well was abandoned and
respudded . Challis2A intersected 17m of net oil sand within the equivalent sand
found oilbearing in Challis1 ( the C3.0 Unit ) plus 6m of net oil pay in a
younger sand ( the C2.2 Unit ) not seen in Challis1 . These units tested oil at
rates up to 9276 stbday and 6792 stbday respectively .

-----Page 8-----

(

Challis3 was drilled in August 1986 to appraise the structure and sand
development in the northeastern part of the field some 800m northeast of
Challis2A . The well encountered only 5m of net oil sand within an eroded C2.2
Unit and 2.5m of net oil sand within the main reservoir sand the C3.0 Unit .
Only the upper sand was tested and it flowed oil at rates up to 7500 stbday . An
oilwater contact at 1410.5 mSS was observed within the C3.0 Unit . This depth
agreed favourably with oil down to and water up to values plus Repeat
Formation Test ( RFT ) pressure interpretations of the oilwater contact in the
previous two wells .

Challis4 was drilled immediately following Challis3 and was designed to
investigate the lateral extent of the field approximately 1.2km southwest of
Challis1 . The well came in very close to prognosis however the main C3.0 Unit
reservoir sand was not present at this location . Results of Challis3 and 4 were
significant in highlighting the complexities of reservoir geometry of this field .

Challis5 was located 900m northwest of Challis1 . Because of abnormally high
velocities within the overlying section Challis5 intersected the Base Cretaceous
Unconformity 33m low to prediction . The C3.0 Unit was truncated and only a

few thin isolated sands were encountered within a thin oil column .

Challis6 was located 1.4km eastnortheast of Challis3 and 2.2km northeast of
Challis2A . The well intersected 18m of net oil sand within a 47.5m gross oil
column the largest column seen to that date at Challis . The main oilbearing
sand unit the C4.0 Unit is older than the oilbearing sands encountered in the
other Challis wells . Challis6 flowed oil at rates up to 7447 stbday .

Challis7 was located 800m northeast of Challis6 . The well intersected 29m of
net oil sand within a 64.5m gross oil column . Oil pay was present within two
major reservoir units the C5.0 and C6.0 sands ( formerly the CS4.1 and CS5.4
sands ) . Challis7 flowed oil at rates up to 2271 stbday .

24 FreDrill Rationale

Challis8 was proposed to appraise the north eastern limit of the Challis Field . Success
of the two previous wells Challis6 and Challis7 had indicated an extension of the
structure further to the northeast . In this area of the field the southwest bounding
fault increases in throw narrows the horst and intersects the major north bounding
fault . The junction of the two major faults represents the northeast limit of the field
which had been mapped 2.5 km to the northeast of Challis7 ( Figure 6 ) .

It was proposed that the sandstones of the Pollard Formation would be intersected
within the oil column at Challis8 . At Challis7 the top of the Pollard Formation was
intersected at 1459mKB which is 20.5m below the fieldwide oilwater contact . The 6
to 7 degree structural dip interpreted in Challis7 would bring these thick Pollard
sandstones into the oil column further to the northeast .

Typically the top 120m of the Pollard Formation is recognised locally as a laterally
continuous deltaic sandstone sequence . Reservoir parameters of the Pollard Formation
sandstones were excellent within previous Challis wells . The sands have porosities in
the range of 253090 similar to sands of the Challis Formation .

2:3 Regional Geology

Permit ACP4 is located in a structurally complex region between the Browse Basin
and the Bonaparte Gulf Basin to the north ( Figure 2 ) . The Precambrian Kimberley
Block lies to the southeast and the Timor Trough a Neogene feature lies to the north .
Post Permian tectonic activity related to Middle Jurassic rifting has imprinted a
prominant northeastsouthwest structural grain onto a preexisting northwestsoutheast
Palaeozoic trend . The structural style of the southern ACP4 area is characterised by
the northeastsouthwest oriented horsts and grabens and tilted fault blocks .

Mesozoic deposition commenced in the Early Triassic with a major marine
transgression over the Late Permian Hyland Bay Formation which deposited the
regionally extensive Mt . Goodwin Formation . This formation consists of a thin basal
transgressive sandstone overlain by a uniform sequence of thick marine siltstones and
claystones . After this rapid transgression in the Early Triassic a period of gradual

regression occurred from Middle Triassic into the Late Triassic .

This regression is represented as the sequence of outer shelf sediments within the
upper Mount Goodwin Formation to the continental deposits of the Nome Formation .
Within this overall regression there are a number of transgressiveregressive sequences .
Excellent reservoir quality sandstones are associated with the deltaic sediments within
the Osprey and Pollard Formations the transgressive shoreface sediments within the
Challis Formation and fluvial sediments within the Nome Formation .

The TriassicJurassic boundary appears regionally to be marked by a sequence of red
beds the Nome Formation implying the area has been progressively uplifted resulting
in widespread deposition of continental sediments . Early to Middle Jurassic
sedimentation continued to be influenced by ongoing tectonic instability . Regional
subsidence allowed the deposition of the Plover Formation consisting of both deltaic
and marginal marine sediments . Good quality reservoirs are associated with
sandstones of this age as well as excellent oilprone source rocks . The Plover
Formation forms part of the producing reservoir in the Jabiru Field .

Widespread uplift and blockfaulting occurred towards the end of the Middle Jurassic .
This tectonic event imprinted the northeastsouthwest structural grain onto the region

characterised by horsts and grabens and tilted fault blocks . Associated uplift and
erosion produced the regionally extensive breakup related unconformity of
approximate Callovian age ( Callovian Unconformity ) . In places extensive erosion
occurred i.e . the AshmoreSahul Platform and Jabiru Terrace removing Lower to
Middle Jurassic sediments and exposing Triassic strata in some of the principally
elevated blocks .

Deposition recommenced progressively in the Late Jurassic with the deposition of the
Swan Group as regional subsidence allowed the incursion of the Late Jurassic to Early
Cretaceous seas . Restricted marine sedimentation occurred over the region the
distribution of facies controlled by the Late Jurassic relative palaeotopography .
However in some areas i.c . Vulcan Subbasin tectonic activity persisted through the
Late Jurassic and into the Early Cretaceous . Deposition of the Swan Group continued
in many areas into the Early Cretaceous before being interrupted in the Neocomian by
broad regional uplift . This event is marked by the development of the regionally
extensive IntraValanginian Unconformity .

Deposition of the Cretaceous aged Bathurst Island Formation was controlled by post
breakup regional subsidence related to slow tilting of the embryonic passive margin
towards the northwest and eustatic sea level changes . Early Cretaceous restricted
claystone deposition gave way in the Early Albian to extensive open marine marls and
carbonate deposition which continued throughout the Cretaceous . The claystones and
marls provide the regional seal to the underlying Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs .
Carbonate deposition continued throughout the Tertiary .

The entire sequence just described was subsequently affected by Late MioceneFarly
Pliocene tectonics related to the collision of the NW Australian passive margin with
the SE Asian plate . Rejuvenation of riftrelated faulting has affected the entire
stratigraphic interval .

24 Stratigraphy

Challis8 penetrated a stratigraphic section ranging in age from Recent to Middle
Triassic . The delineation of the age units given is based upon well log correlations
with nearby wells and some micropaleontology within part of the Cretaceous section .

A Predicted vs Actual section is presented in Figure 3 summarizing the operations
data . Age lithology and drilling information are given on the Composite Log
( Enclosure 3 ) .

Miocene to Recent

Formation : BB Oliver and Barracouta
Interval : Seafloor to 461mKB
Thickness : 358m

As the 20 casing was run to a depth of 495m no samples were recovered from the
surface to this depth .

Locally the Miocene to Recent sediments consists of massive bioclastic calcarenite .
The regionally correlatable Oliver Sand Member at the Base of the Miocene is
interpreted to have been intersected from 450 to 461mKB .

Eocene

Formation : 8B8BHibernia
Interval : 461 to 821mKB
Thickness : : 360m

The interval from 505m to 721m consisted of calcarenite with minor interbedded
sandstones .

The calcarenites are described as offwhite to light brownish grey brittle to very hard
fine to coarse grained moderate to well cemented with calcite occasional fossil
fragments and forams and poor to good visible porosity .

The thin sandstones occur over the interval 600 to 642mKB and are described as
medium grained well sorted with fair inferred porosity .

The Grebe Sandstone Member was intersected from 721m to 821mKB . The sand is
described as quartzose clear unconsolidated medium to coarse grained with no visible
cement and excellent porosity .

In the Challis area this sand is approximately 100m thick and directly overlies
Paleocene sediments .

Paleocene

Formation : Johnson
Interval : 821 to 1056mKB
Thickness : : 235m

The Johnson Formation consists of calcarenites and minor calcilutites . The
calcarenites are described as white to offwhite fine to medium grained moderately
hard with common carbonate and in part dolomitic cement and common fossil
fragments . Near the top of the Paleocene these calcarenites are interbedded with thin
sandstones . A few thin sandstones were also intersected from 980 to 1030mKB .
Towards the base the calcarenites often become argillaceousin part and increase in
degree of cementation . This is also associated with an increase in the proportion of
calcilutite in the sequence . Paleocene carbonates unconformably overly Cretaceous
sediments .

Total Thickness : 305m

The Bathurst Island Group at Challis8 ranges in age from Valanginian to

-----Page 19-----

15

Maastrichtian and is subdivided into six distinct Formations .

Borde Formation

Interval : 1056 to 1213 mKB
Thickness : 157m
Age : Late Campanian to Maastrichtian

The Borde Formation consists of marl and calcareous claystones . The sequence is
consistent to that intersected in previous Challis wells .

The maris are described as silty offwhite to light grey soft to firm sticky with
abundant silt sized calcareous and glauconite grains and traces of pyrite forams and
Inoceramus fragments . The calcareous claystones are similar but are medium to dark
grey in colour and subfissile .

The upper boundary of the Borde Formation is marked by the lithological break from
the Paleocene carbonates into Cretaceous marls It is defined on logs by a distinct
sonic slow down .

Fenelon Formation

Interval : 1213 to 1246 mKB
Thickness : 33m
Age : Late Santonian to Late Campanian

The Fenelon Formation as intersected at Challis8 consists of marl and argillaceous
calcilutite .

Maris are light grey to greygreen soft sticky with abundant Inoceramus fragments and
common forams . The argillaceous calcilutite is offwhite to light grey soft dispersive
with common to rare silt sized glauconite and calcareous grains .

The upper boundary of the Fenelon Formation is marked by the lithological change
from medium to dark grey calcareous claystones to calcilutite or marl commonly a

-----Page 20-----

16

significant increase in carbonate content .

This is defined by the usual negative drilling break and on logs by a decrease in
gamma ray and increase in resistivity responses .

Across the Cleghorn Horst a minor hiatus may occur . This sequence boundary can be
correlated regionally and represents the IntraCampanian event . It is evident within
Challis wells as lithologies at the top of the Fenelon Formations are variable ( but all
are distinctly higher in carbonate content than the overlying Borde Formation ) .

Thickness variation within the Fenelon Formation intersected in Challis wells are in
the range of 15 metres .

Gibson Formation

Interval : 1246 to 1297mKB
Thickness : 51m
Age : Early Santonian

This interval is comprised of marls calcareous claystones with minor argillaceous
calcilutite .

The marl is light greygreen to yellow brown occasionally reddishpinkish brown soft
sticky with common calcareous fragments .

The calcareous claystones are described as grey dull yellow brown firm blocky to
subfissile which grade to marl .

The Gibson Formation is distinctive in that there is a gradual increase of carbonate
content in the clastics grading up to calcilutites . This is overlain by a sequence with a
gradual decrease in carbonate content grading back to calcareous claystone . This
sequence is distinctive on wireline logs ROP and calcimetry traces . The upper
boundary of the Gibson Formation is distinguished by the sudden decrease in CaCO3
content and corresponding increase in gamma ray and decrease of resistivity on the
wireline logs .

-----Page 21-----

17

Correlations of wireline logs suggests the possibility of a minor fault ( throws less than
20m ) at the FenelonGibson boundary . It appears that uppermost Gibson Formation is
missing .

Woolaston Formation

Interval : 12971313mKB
Thickness : 16m
Age : Early Santonian ?

This thin interval comprises of argillaceous calcilutite and marl . The calcilutite is
argillaceous offwhite to light grey soft slightly sticky and dispersive grading to mall in
part . The marl is light grey and light yellow brown soft with traces of forams and
calcareous fragments .

The Woolaston Formation is commonly 50 to 60m thick in the Challis area consisting
of marls and calcareous claystones of Cenomanian to Late Santonian in age .

At Challis7 correlations and micropalaeontology ( Appendix 3 ) have indicated that a
significant section of the Wollaston Formation is missing . Overall the total amount of
missing section is approximately 6070 metres . The current interpretation is that
section is mission due to faulting .

Jamieson Formation

Interval : 1313m to 1343mKB

Thickness : 30m

Age : Aptian to Albian

The Jamieson Formation consists of a sequence of dark grey claystones which grade
upwards into midgrey calcareous claystones . The claystones are blocky to subfissile

firm to moderately hard and micromicaeous in part .

The upper boundary of the Jamieson Formation is recognised as mid grey claystones

-----Page 22-----

18

pass upwards into marls of the Woolaston Formation .

At Challis8 micropalaeontology studies and well correlations indicate that there are no
Cenomanian sediments in the well . This is likely due to faulting rather than non
deposition .

Echuca Shoals Formation

Interval : 1343 to 1361mKB
Thickness : 18m
Age : Middle Valanginian to Barremian

The Echuca Shoals Formation is a distinct lithological unit which unconformably
overlies the Triassic sediments on the Cleghorn Horst .

Its lithology consists of glauconitic claystone described as dark grey to black
moderately hard subfissile noncalcareous with abundant fine to medium glauconitic
grains .

The thickness of the Echuca Shoals Formation is consistently 15 to 20 metres and its

upper boundary defined on the wireline logs as a distinct increase in gamma ray .

( Refer to Figure 5 Triassic Stratigraphic Correlation ) .

Sahul Group :

Interval : 1361 1700mKB
Thickness : 339m

Age : Ladinian to Carnian

Correlations with nearby Challis wells suggest that the total depth of the well
( 1700mKB ) was close to the Tr3bTr4 biozone boundary .

Both the Challis and Pollard Formations are recognised within the Triassic at Challis8 .

Challis Formation

Interval : 1361 to 1392mKB
Thickness : 31m
Age : Ladinian to Carnian ( Middle to Upper Triassic )

Subcropping the IntraValanginian unconformity at Challis8 is a thin interval of Challis
Formation consisting of a sequence of claystones with thin interbedded sandstones and
carbonates .

The claystones are described as ligbt to dark grey firm to occasionally hard
calcareousdolomitic in part and silty and arenaceous in part .

This basal section of Challis Formation has a few thin sandstones with only fair
reservoir quality and do not appear to be continuous . Although they occur within the
oil column they are not of commercial significance . In other Challis wells core has
been cut through similar type sediments and they are interpreted to have been
deposited in a tidal flatlagoonal environment which was protected from the open sea
by a barrier island complex .

The major sand units which are oil bearing in previous Challis wells have been
truncated at this location .

Pollard Formation

Interval : 1392 to 1700mKB
Thickness : 308 m :
Age : Ladinian to Carnian ( Middle to Late Triassic )

Regionally the Pollard Formation consists of a transgressive to regressive stratigraphic
sequence . At Challis8 it is only the regressive sequence consisting of deltaic clastics
that have been intersected . Generally the interval is a gross coarsening upward
sequence with clean thick sandstones at the top of the Pollard Formation .

One 9m core was cut at the top of the Pollard Formation from 1396 to 1405mKB . The

-----Page 24-----

20

cored interval was comprised of a medium grained sandstone which is well sorted firm
to friable poorly cemented with silica and occasionally calcareous cement traces of
redbrown argillaceous matrix and excellent porosity and permeability . ( See core
description Appendix 2 . )

This core is typical of the sandstone bodies near the top of the Pollard Formation .
Sandstones are fine to medium grained and have excellent reservoir quality .

Within the deltaic sequence the amount of clay matrix generally increases with depth .
From below 1489m to 1592m the sandstones have common white to pale green
argillaceous matrix and is interbedded with claystone which are varicoloured white
light grey light brown redbrown and greygreen . They are predominantly non
calcareous moderately hard and subfissile .

There is a thin interval of clean medium grained sandstone from 1592 to 1619mKB . It
has only minor amount of matrix and cement with good to excellent visible porosity .
This sand overlies a sequence of argillaceous sandstone with poor reservoir quality and
redbrown claystones .

Reservoir quality is excellent within the Pollard sandstone units but the quality
decreases with depth as the proportion of clay matrix increases .

As stated previously the Pollard Formation intersected at Challis8 represents a
prograding deltaic sequence .

Fieldwide the Pollard Formation can be subdivided into units using this depositional
model as a framework . Correlations across a few key wells are shown in Figure 5 .

The oilwater contact intersected at Challis8 was 6.5m below the top of the P2 unit .

It has been interpreted from production test data that the thin claystones within the P1
unit will act as local barriers to production . It is apparent from wireline log
cortelations that these claystones are not laterally continuous but are localised lenses
within what is essentially a thick sandstone package .

-----Page 26-----

2:5 Unconformities

Two major unconformities are recognised at Challis8 the Base Miocene unconformity
and a Base Cretaceous unconformity .

Miocene sediments unconformably overlie the Eocene at 461mKB . This boundary is
defined regionally at the base of the Oliver Sandstone Member and overlies Eocene
carbonates .

The Oliver Sandstone Member was interpreted to have been intersected from 450 to
461mKB at Challis8 .

Middle Valanginian glauconitic claystones of the Echuca Shoals Formation
unconformably overlies Triassic sediments at a depth of 1361mKB . The unconformity
has been defined by palynology in previous wells at Challis8 it is recognised by a
change in lithology and by wireline log correlations .

The Base Cretaceous unconformity spans from Lower to Middle Jurassic through to
BerrisianMiddle Valanginian ages and incorporates a number of tectonic events .

The Cretaceous sediments at Challis is regionally thinner compared to other ACP4
wells . It is likely that at the Challis8 location disconformities andor condensed
sequences are present within the Cretaceous .

-----Page 27-----

2:6 Structure Seismic

The Challis feature is a low relief horst block cut by a major fault to the north and
minor subparallel faults to the south and east . Dip closure exists to the southwest
while the spillpoint is located at the northeast end of the field .

The previous appraisal well Challis7 drilled 800km NE of Challis6 was sited within
a narrow part of the horst where seismic data quality was fair but where mapping had
indicated a northeastward extension of the horst .

Success at Challis6 had upgraded the northeast end of the horst and Challis7 was
designed as a further appraisal well northeast of the field . Challis7 was the first
Challis Field well to be drilled outside the limits of the interpolated 3D grid where
data quality becomes highly variable but does not necessarily deteriorate . It was
recognised prior to drilling Challis8 that considerable risk was involved in pinpointing
the Base Cretaceous unconformity ( top reservoir ) in time . Moreover minor velocity
fluctuations have also been noted across the field and as a result the prognosed depth
to the top of the reservoir section was taken as a rough estimate only .

Seismic data quality was however adequate to predict that the horst ( at the reservoir
horizon ) did extend to the northeast as far as the Challis8 location . In particular an
older line HJ4487 showed abrupt terminations of events and changes in data
character across the major bounding faults . The quality of this line increased the
probability of success at Challis8 prior to drilling .

As currently mapped the horst still extends northeast of Challis8 for over a kilometre .
New dip lines from the HJ10 and HJ11 surveys should provide better definition of the
northeast limit of the field . In addition new strike lines in this area should be
adequate for observing the changes in dip within the Challis Formation as noted in
Challis6 Challis7 and Challis8 . This new data should have predictive power for
additional wells in the field in terms of determining what part of the Triassic section
will be within the oil column .

2.7 Porosity and Permeability

The Tertiary to Recent sediments in Challis8 are comprised of porous and permeable
calcarenites and sandstone . The lack of a full suite of open hole logs precludes
quantitative analysis .

No porous intervals were intersected within the Cretaceous sediments .

Porosities and permeabilities in the targeted Triassic reservoir interval are excellent .
Logderived effective porosities of the P1 reservoir sands intersected within the oil
column average 29.590 which agree with core derived porosities . ( See Appendix 1 and
Challis8 WCR Basic Data Volume . )

Core permeabilities adjusted to reservoir conditions within the reservoir vary between
800md and 2100md averaging approximately 1360md .

Within subunits P2 and P3 of the Pollard Formation porosity and permeability
decreases with the increasing depth . This reduction in reservoir quality is due solely to
an increase in clay content .

-----Page 30-----

Tertiary

No hydrocarbon indications were observed in the Tertiary section during the drilling of

Cretaceous

No porous intervals were intersected in the Cretaceous section however small
hydrocarbon shows were reported . These are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 .

It is interpreted that these hydrocarbon shows are associated with fracture zones
( shows from 11371172mKB ) or fault zones ( shows from 12781304m ) .

The traces of fluorescence described in the cuttings mostly occur on the cuttings
surface . Over the interval 12781281mKB fluorescence was described on the surfaces
or in small fractures in crystalline calcite which may have been precipitated in a
fracture or fault zone .

Correlations within the Cretaceous section at Challis8 indicate a fault zone over the
intervai 12961314mKB .

The origin of these traces of hydrocarbons is most likely to be from the oil
accumulated in the underlying Triassic reservoirs .

Triassi

A 77.5m oil column was intersected in Challis8 from the Base Cretaceous
Unconformity ( 1361m ) to 1438.5mKB . Strong hydrocarbon shows were observed within
sandstones from the core and cuttings .

This oil column is depicted extremely well from the gas curves on the mudlog . At
1361mKB total gas increased significantly to up to 590 . From this depth significant
proportions of the heavier gases ( up to C5t ) were recorded . The high gas readings

-----Page 31-----

continued to the oilwater contact at 1438.5mKB and then at this depth dropped to
only trace amounts .

10096 pale yellow fluorescence with instant cut fluorescence was observed in Core # 1
( 13961404.1mKB ) . Bright fluorescence with cut was also observed in the sandstone

cuttings within the oil column .

From below 1438.5mKB to total depth no fluorescence was observed and total gas
maintained background levels with only traces of C3 t fractions .

Wireline logging confirmed that the sands below 1438.5mKB are water saturated .

22 Post Drill Analysis

Challis8 was drilled in Licence ACL3 in March 1989 located 860m northeast of
Challis7 . The well was proposed to appraise the northeastern limit of the Challis
Field . The target horizon the Base Cretaceous Unconformity was intersected at

1335mSS 26m low to prognosis .

A total gross oil column of 77.5m was intersected in the well being the thickest column
so far in the Challis Field . Within this gross oil column ( 13351412.5mSS ) 36 metres
of net oil pay was intersected in the targeted Pollard Formation .

One 9m core was cut through the top of the reservoir unit . Effective porosities
average 27.490 and permeabilities adjusted to reservoir conditions average 1360md .

A production test was carried out over the interval 1393.5 to 1409.5mKB which flowed
oil up to 7764 stbday on a 12864 choke .

Challis8 was targeted to intersect the oil column within the thick deltaic sandstone
sequence of the Pollard Formation . A 31m interval of claystones of the Challis
Formation subcropped the Base Cretaceous Unconformity . The top of the Pollard
Formation was intersected at 1392m representing the top of the pay zone at Challis8 .
In previous Challis wells the Pollard Formation had been intersected below the oil
water contact .

Challis8 added a significant amount of proved and probable oil to the reserves of the
Challis Field . The results of Challis8 also indicated further possible attic oil volumes
within the P1 and P2 units of the Pollard Formation further to the northeast .

Challis8 was suspended as an oil producer .

Challis 8 was drilled as an appraisal well in license ACL3 in the
Timor Sea . The well was designed to provide further geological
and engineering information and ald development of the Challis 0il
Field and was drilled 860 m east northeast of Challis 7 . The well
intersected thin oil bearing calcareous sands below the Base
Cretaceous Unconformity at 1361.0m before encountering good

quality reservoir sands at 1392m .

A gross hydrocarbon column of 77.5 m is interpreted from the
ollwater contact at 1438.5mMDKB to the Base Cretaceous
Unconformity at 1361.0m . The main porous section of the interval
exhibited an average porosity of 27.18 and an average water

saturatlon of 193 .

Challis 8 was cased and completed as a future producing well to be
tied in to the Challis Floating Production Facility .

-----Page 39-----

INTRODUCTION

Challis 8 was drilled as an appraisal well on the Challis 0il
Field in ACL3 in the Timor Sea . The well was designed to further
define the structure and sand development of the field . The
primary objective was the Trlassic sandstone reservoir section
encountered in the other Challis wells .

Challis 8 was spudded on the 23rd March 1989 and reached TD 1700
m ( drillers depth ) on 7th April 1989 .

After logging and testing the well was cased and completed as a

future producing well .

Note that loggers depth are used in this report unless specified
otherwise . The abbreviatlons used for depth measurements are
listed below .

MD measured depth .

TUD m true vertical depth .

MDKB m measured depth below kelly bushing .
TVDSS m true vertical depth below mean sea level .

Wireline Testing

The Repeat Formation Tester ( RFT ) was run during suite 1l and 10
successful pretests were performed and 2 pretests were tight . No

samples were attempted .

-----Page 40-----

Production Tests

One drill stem test was performed over the perforated interval
1393.5 1409.5m which produced oll at 4400 stbd with a gasoil
ratio ( GOR ) of 199 scfbbl over the 16 hour main flow period . A
high rate ( sand production ) test was performed and recorded a flow
of 7866 stbd with a COR of 258 scfbbl . The well was completed
for future production before the drilling rig was released .

Coring

One conventional core was cut from 13961405m ( drillers depth )

from which 8.11 m were recovered giving a recovery of 90s .

Sidewall Cores

No sidewall cores were attempted .

Logs Run

During the drilling of Challis 8 Teleco Sonat MWD equipment was
used to provide directional information as well as Gamna Ray and
16 Short Normal resistivity . The Gamma RayResistivity data was
recorded from the 13.375 casing shoe at 1113m to TD ( 1700m ) . A
Schlumberger CSU unit was used to record the wireline logs

summarised below .

HOLE CONDITIONS

Saliper
The interval logged with Suite 1 was drilled with a 12.25 bit .

From the end of the 17.5 hole below the 13.375 casing shoe ( 1113
m ) at 1125m to 1160m the hole size average gradually increased
from 12.25 to 14.5 on the MSFL caliper and 15 on the IDL
caliper . The SDHT calipers indicated that the hole was slightly
oval in section . From 1160m to 1315m the hole size reflected
changes in lithology with the shaly sections washing out and the
more calcareous sections remaining close to gauge . The maximum
hole size recorded was 17 with assymetrical washouts at 1200m
and 1250m . From 1315m to 1360m the hole size gradually increased
from 12.5 to 14 with with highly rugose washouts corresponding
with shely horizons . From 1315m to 1390m shaly intervals produced
highly rugose but symmetrical washouts . Sands over this interval
were in gauge . From 1390m to 1700m ( TD ) the hole was mostly
swooth and in gauge with evidence of filtercake build up on the

sands .

The interval 13601690m was evaluated using the model described in
Appendix 1 . Log readings over these intervals were read from the
Schlumberger EDIT tape and corrected for environmental effects .
Plots of the interpretation results are given in Enclosures 1 and

2 and a listing in Appendix 2 .
Formation Water Salinity

A formation water resistivity of 0.105 Ohmn at 63.57C was taken
from the Pickett Plot over the interval 14501650m which equates
to a value of 0.19 Ohmm at 25c or an equivalent NaCl salinity of
33000 ppm . A cementation exponent of 1.80 and saturation
exponent of 1.93 have been used . These values were determined
previously from special core analysis of plugs from Challis 1 and
2A ( Locke 1989 ) . The cementation exponent and Rw are shown on

Figure 1 .

The SP log shows a deflection of L15 mV opposite permeable water
filled zones below 1520m and its considered valid as the formation

water is expected to be less saline than the drilling mud

-----Page 43-----

filtrate . Two Static Spontaneous Potential ( SSP ) derived
formation water resistivitles ( Rw ) have been derived .

SSsP Rw at 25c
415 mV 0.05 Ohmm ( Cox 4 Raymer 1976. method )

415 mV 0.11 Ohmm ( Schlumberger Chart Book Method )

Both values are considered to be in error as they will result in
the calculation of hydrocarbon saturations in water zones . The
Pickett Plot value has been chosen to give 1003 saturation in the

interpreted water zones .

The volume of shale ( Vsh ) was calculated by taking the minimun of
the gamma ray and densityneutron crossplot derived values . The
secondary minerals used were for the interval 1360 1390m
Glauconite ( density 2.54 porosity 388 ) and Muscovite ( 2.82 204 )
for the interval 13901690nm .

DISCUSSION OF INTERPRETATION RESULTS

Note that only one suite of logs was run . Only a gamma ray log
was recorded from the seafloor to 1113m . No shows were recorded

over this interval .

Sultel

The interval from 11131361m consists of interbedded calcareous
claystone calcilutite and marl . As stated above the shalier
sections washed out badly . Minor visual and gas shows were
recorded throughout this interval and may have been associated
with thin calcite lined joints . The section below the Base
Cretaceous Unconformity at 1361m and above the the main reservolr
sands ( 1392m ) consists of iInterbedded dolomitic sandstone and
claystone . Below 1392m the section consists of interbedded
sandstone and claystone with thin carbonate beds occuring towards

the base of the well . The sandstones are quartzose with varying

-----Page 44-----

amounts of mica glauconite feldspar and clay with minor silica

and carbonate cement

Figures 2 and 3 compare the core measurements of porosity and
permeability at ambient and overburden pressures . Regresaslon

analysis results in the following equations .

@ overburden ms 1.0466 xP ambient 3.186
and
log ( K overburden ) 1.0838 x log ( K ambient ) 0.3871

These relationships were used to transform the core measurements
taken only at ambient conditions to overburden conditions . These
data were plotted in Figure 4 which shows the relationship
between porosity and permeability . It was decided to use the
porosilty cutoff derived for Challis 7 ( Locke1989 ) of 18.58 for
calculating pay in this report . The data from the Challis 8 core
did not provide a sufficient range of values to allow the
derivation of a value for this well . Figure 5 shows a crossplot
of log derived porosity versus overburden corrected core pososity
exhibiting a close cluster of points . The core data are also

plotted on the results plot for comparison with the log data .

A total of 36.4m of pay is Interpreted over the interval
1366.41438.5 mMDKB . A summary of the reservoir properties is
given as Table 1 . The section between 1366.4 and 1392m
contributes little to the net sand as most of the Zone consists of
claystone with thin interbedded sands exhibiting low porosity and

high water saturation .

Figure 6 1s an NGS crossplot of Potassium vs Thorlum over the
interval 13601390m and shows the clay lithologies to be mainly
mixed layer clays . The main reservoir sands below 1392m contain
similar clay minerals ( Figure 7 ) down to about 1430m where the
muscovite ( or other high Potassium mineral ) content of the matrix

appears to increase ( Figure 8 ) .

The oilwater contact is interpreted at 1438.5 mMDKB ( 1412.5 msS )
which is at slight varlance with the field oillwater contact of
1410.5 mSS . A zone of residual hydrocarbon saturation is


-----Page 45-----

intrepreted from the oilwater contact to 1475m . The hydrocarbon

saturation averages 108 and considered to be immobile .

Table 2 is a summary of the porous sandstone intervals below the

o11water contact .

APPENDIK 1
LOG INTERPRETATION METHOD

The quantitative log interpretatlon was undartaken using the LOGCALC
software system developed by Scientific SoftwareIntercomp . The
system 1s designed to analyse and manipulate well log data and
provides facilities to generate tabular and trace plot displays . The
interpretation model used by LOGCALC has been developed by BHP

Petroleum and is summarised belov .

1 . True formatlon resistivity ( Rt ) 1s calculated from the Dual
Laterolog and MSFL logs by correcting for the effects of

invasion .

2 . Flushed zone resistivity ( Rxo ) is calculated by correcting the
MSFL log for wudcake Chickness .

3 . The volume of shale ( Vsh ) 1s calculated using five separate shale
indicators :
1 ) gamma ray
1i ) neutron
iii ) neutrondensity crossplot
lv ) sonicdensity crossplot
v ) sonicneutTton crossplot
or
vi ) the minimum of two or more of the above

indicators .

The optimum Vsh indicator 1s selected and used in the

interpretation .

NN Total porosity is derived from an analysis of the
neutrondensity crossplot using a shaly sand model .
Corrections are made for the presence of hydrocarbons
andor a secondary mineral .

Effective porosity is calculated from the total porosity by

correcting for shale as given belov .

fe Pt Vsh.Gtsh


-----Page 58-----

A sonic porosity 1s calculated using the
RaymerHuntGardner algorithm ( 1980 ) and used where hole
conditions are rugose or the neutron and density logs are
unavailable .

5 . Water saturation ( Sw ) 1s calculated using an equation
developed by I. Juhasz ( 1981 ) . The equation is a
derivation of the WaxmanSmits model but uses the concept
of normalised Qv which enables all parameters to be
obtained directly from the logs . It can be expressed in the
form of the Archie Equation as given belov .

One 9m 514 diameter core was cut in Challis8 with 8.1m being recovered . The
interval of Core # 1 is 1396 to 1404.1mKB .

The cored interval is within the Pollard Formation of Mid to Late Triassic in age .

Of the 8.1m of core recovered 10090 of this was reservoir quality sandstone . A full
core description is presented in log form in Enclosure 2 .

ENVIRONMENTAL . INTERPRETATION

The distinctive features of the cored interval are the uniform grain size ( medium
grained ) and high angle cross bedding sets with numerous reactivation surfaces .

Mineralogically the sandstone is dominated by quartz with minor amounts of pink
feldspar and traces of heavy minerals mica and glauconite . The quartz grains are
frosted and iron stained and the clay matrix ( as trace ) has a redbrown colouration due
to the presence of oxidised iron minerals ( see Petrology Report Appendix 4 ) .

The top few hundred metres of Pollard Formation is recognised regionally as a
prograding delta sequence .

As discussed in Section 2.4 the top unit ( P1 ) of the Pollard is recognised across Challis
and Cassini as a delta plain environment .

The distinctive features described in Core # 1 and the mineralogy is characteristic of a
distributary channel sand body within a delta plain .

The P1 unit is quite variable in character throughout the fields . It consists of blocky
coarsening upward and fining upward log signatures . The types of sand bodies they
may represent are distributary channels shoreface deposits alluvial channels with the
thinner sand bodies being crevasse splays .

The P1 unit is significantly thicker at Challis1 and Challis2A . This may have been an

-----Page 75-----

area proximal to the major alluvial feeder channel system .

Another distinctive feature of Core # 1 is the fracturing throughout the sand . Some
major fractures are filled with crushed framework grains with a higher proportion of
clay matrix as a result of disolution of feldspar grains ( see Appendix 4 ) .

It is unknown at this stage whether these fractures would provide local barriers to oil
production .

INTRODUCTION

Ditch cuttings fran the interval 1259m to 1334m in Challis7 and fran the
interval 1236m to 1323n in Challis8 have been scrutinised for foraminifera
and nannoplankton to establish a biostratigraphic breakdown using the KOM
zonal scheme . By relating these results to wireline log character and
comparing with wireline log character in other wells dated using the KOCM
scheme e.g . Challis2A Challis3 and Challis5 it has been possible to
delineate faults in both Challis7 and Challis8 . The confidence rating for
all zonal assignments is given in brackets ( 1 : high level of confidence 2 :
moderate level of confidence 3 : low level of confidence ) .

BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC RESULTS

The total reliance on ditch cutting sample control has made biostratigraphic
subdivision of the well sections difficult because of the problen of caved
calcareous microfossil assemblages cbscuring insitu assemblages .
Fortunately the yield of calcareous microfoss the Early Campanian to
upper Iate Albian section in most Challis wells is consistently high thus
reducing the likelyhood of rich assemlages caving dowmhole and obscuring
more impoverished intervals .

1 . SUMMARY

Five core plug samples were forwarded by BHP Petroleum via Core Services of
Australia Limited on 29th . June 1989 for petrographic analysis . An additional
sample sent earlier for brief description was included with the others for detailed
analysis . The work requested for each sample included :

Thin section preparation
Brief description
Composition by point count
Grain size analysis
Photomicroscopy

XRD analysis

Clay proportions by XRD
SEM analysis .

Of particular interest to the client was :

The nature of any cementation

Clay content abundance and stability
Paragenetic sequence

Secondary porosity development
Pore throat size

The minimal content of authigenic clay in the samples combined with the small size
of most of the samples made it impossible to collect enough material to run XRD
traces for semi quantitative analysis . The deletion of this technique from this suite of
samples was done in consultation with the client . EDS analysis combined with SEM
provided adequate information .

All the samples investigated are similar petrographically largely reflecting their close
stratigraphic proximity and similar depositional and diagenetic history . They are
clean moderately well sorted to well sorted fine to medium grained subfeldsarenites .
Subangular to subrounded grains confirm only moderate maturity as does the
relatively high feldspar content ( 122296 of the solid rock component ) . However the
sorting characteristics indicate good textural maturity . The provenance of the
sediment is complex with the dominant source an acid igneous terrain with some
metamorphic and volcanic contribution . Rounding of quartz overgrowths shows that
some of the quartz grains were inherited from an earlier sediment .

Many of the feldspar grains have been altered and partly dissolved . The more
reactive plagioclase grains show extensive alteration to illite and minor kaolinite . The
less reactive K feldspars are incipiently illitized . In SEM it is evident that K feldspars
are preferentially dissolving along crystallographic axes .

Slight to moderate compactional effects were seen in all samples . These include the
bending of mica flakes and tangential to slightly sutured contacts between framework
grains

All samples are quite friable indicating a lack of cement . Three stages of quartz
overgrowths were observed but the first two of these were inherited so that only the
last stage that of microcrystalline quartz has any effect in the cementation of these
sediments . There are traces of authigenic feldspar . There are also trace to minor
amounts of authigenic clay dominantly kaolinite with some illite . The small amount
of clay in the samples and the dominance of kaolinite in that suite indicate that clay
reactions are unlikely to cause any problems during drilling or production . No
reactive clays were seen in the samples .

Carbonates siderite and ankerite contribute to the weak cementation of the samples
and exhibit complex relationships . Micritic siderite possibly synsedimentary and
ankerite rhombs are the earliest stages . These rthombs have been rounded and pitted
by dissolution . Sparry siderite surrounds the micrite and this too shows rounding in
some cases . The latest stage is euhedral siderite grading to euhedral ankerite . The
carbonate cements have the potential to obliterate porosity in some areas and enhance
pi in others . These relationships need to be mapped out in order to fully exploit the
ie

Good sorting moderate compaction and minor amounts of cement have allowed
excellent preservation of primary porosity ranging from 172596 . Secondary porosity
from feldspar dissolution and minor fracturing enhances the effective porosity to 20
279k . Total porosity is a little greater and includes microporosity associated with
kaolin and illite .

Pore sizes are generally in the range from 210 microns with associated throat sizes
from 12 microns largely reflecting the moderate sorting fine to medium sand grains
and the lack of cement . Some larger pores and pore throats up to 20 and 5 microns
respectively are mainly oversize features associated with feldspar dissolution .

The following tentative sequence of diagenetic events has been established for the
samples provided ( considering that the sequence may not be in sttrict order as
adjacent events may have occurred concurrently ) :

1 . Precipitation of micritic siderite

2 . Compaction

3 . Growth of ankerite spar and embaying of framework grains

4 . Dissolution and alteration of feldspar and mica to form kaolinite and illite

5 . Minor dissolution of carbonate

6 . Overgrowth of authigenic feldspar and microcrystalline quartz cement

7 . Growth of siderite and ankerite spar with progressive changes in water chemistry .
Associated quartz embayment .

2 . INTRODUCTION

This report contains petrographic descriptions of 5 core plug samples from BHPPs
Challis # 8 well in addition to that of a core sample ( 1398.2m ) done previously . Bulk
Xray diffraction and scanning electron microscope analyses were performed on each
sample to supplement information from thin sections .

The study aimed to investigate :

1 ) the degree and nature of cementation

2 ) the type abundance paragenesis and stability of clays present
3 ) the possibility of secondary porosity development and

4 ) pore throat size .

The following samples were analyzed :
Core plug # 5A 1397.2m
Core 1398.2m
Core plug # 11 1399.0m
Core plug # 14A 1399.9m
Core plug # 22 1402.0m
Core plug # 26A 1403.5m
3 . METHODS

All samples were briefly described in hand specimen . Part of each sample was then
impregnated with blue dyed araldite before thin section preparation in order to
describe porosity and permeability . Thin sections were scanned to determine
lithology composition porosity and textural relationships then photographed . Point
counts of 300 were performed on each sample . Grain size analyses were undertaken
by measuring the long axes of liberated grains from scaled photographs converting
millimetres to phi units and performing statistical analyses on both sets of data to
give mean grain size and standard deviation .

To determine the bulk mineralogy by Xray diffraction subsamples were selected
and hand ground in acetone prior to preparation as oriented smears on glass slides .
The technique was useful to investigate clay mineralogy in these small samples .
Smears were run from 3 to 75 degrees 2 theta at 1 degreceminute using CoK
radiation 50kV and 35mA on a Philips PW1050 diffractometer . Further study of
clays using XRD was discounted due to their paucity .

Subsamples with fresh surfaces and minimal drilling mud were mounted in araldite
on aluminium pintype stubs for SEM analysis . They were evaporatively coated with
carbon ( 15nm ) and goldpalladium ( 20nm ) prior to viewing in a Philips 505 at 20kV .
Double coatings were used to bind these friable samples . The elemental composition
of each mineral photographed was identified using a Tracor Northern ( TN 5500 )
energy dispersive spectrometer .

4 . PETROGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS
4.1 Core plug # 5A 1397.2 metres
Macro description

The material supplied was a core plug end ( 28mm x 36mm diameter ) taken from the
outer drill core with drilling mud invasion to a depth of at least 1mm . It consists of
fine buffcoloured sand which is well sorted very friable and noncalcareous . Grain
size analysis detailed in Table 1 shows the sample to be well sorted with a mean
grain size of 0.24 mm . There is a strong hydrocarbon odour .

Quartz is dominant with minor feldspar micas and heavy minerals . Varicties of
quartz grains include clear pitted conchoidally fractured and iron oxide stained as
seen from liberated grains ( Fig . 1 ) .

Bedding and soft sediment deformation are outlined by a 1mm wide brown Fe rich
layer . A soft silty layer of 1mm width runs parallel to this .

Micro description

A well sorted poorly cemented fine to medium grained subfeldsarenite . Grains tend
to be subangular with cleavage fragments of feldspar . Larger grains are rounded .
Contacts are mainly tangential with some straight the larter implying overgrowths
which is attested to by the presence of dust rims .

Porosity and permeability are excellent due to high primary intergranular porosity
( Fig . 2 ) calculated at 16.796 ( Table 2 ) . Microporosity is associated with kaolin and
the preferential dissolution of feldspars along crystallographic axes ( Fig . 3 ) . Some
oversize pores are probably due to dissolution but minor plucking during slide
preparation has also occurred .

Quartz is represented by some composite grains displays overgrowths in optical
continuity ( rarely of polycrystalline form ) and often has slightly undulose extinction
implying limited straining . Minor corrosion by siderite is evident . There are some
composite quartz grains . The feldspar content of 15956 suggests moderate
sedimentary immaturity . Varieties include microcline and orthoclase . Plagioclase
tends to have undergone illitization . Cleavage fragments are common and rare
adularia ( ? ) overgrowths on microcline occur . Muscovite was seen to be bent due to
compachon . Detrital biotite is present sometimes displaying alteration to chlorite .
Other constituents include chert and metamorphic lithics ( 8.395 ) opaque heavy
minerals bitumen detrital accessories and traces of matrix . Siderite occurs as
rhombohedra along grain boundaries causing minor etching of quartz ( Fig . 4 ) and
feldspar and their overgrowths . Micritic carbonate is rare .

Kaolin is present as patches of booklets or in mixtures with illite . The latter appear
to replace some rounded grains . Illite is a minor component of the total rock and
occurs in grain replacement or matrix . Illite replacement of feldspars is common .
Some clays have a brownish colour due to the presence of iron and occlude pore
space and cement grains to a minor extent .

Xray diffraction
Quartz is dominant with minor feldspar ( microcline and plagioclase ) . Trace amounts
of crystalline kaolinite are indicated by sharp peaks . Muscoviteillite siderite and

ankerite also occur in trace amounts . The small sylvite ( KCI ) peak is due to drilling
mud ( Fig . 5 ) .

Scanning electron microscopy

High proportion of primary porosity ( Fig . 6 ) with rare oversized pores . Average
intergranular pore diameter is 4 microns with pore throats of 1 to2 microns . The
sample as a whole is relatively unconsolidated with only rare euhedral scalenohedra
of siderite to act as a cement ( Figs . 78 ) . Microcline as identified from EDS analyses
occurs in moderate abundance ( up to 1596 ) and is frequently highly etched ( Figs .
910 ) along crystallographic axes . Muscovite is a minor component which has
buckled due to compaction and has been altered to kaolin ( Figs . 1112 ) .

42 Core 1398.2 metres

( The macro description and micro description of the tight zone in this sample are
taken from an earlier report and included here to provide complete coverage . )

Macro description

Two adjacent pieces of 14 core of diameter 105mm were supplied . One piece was
35mm thick and the other 10mm thick . The sample is a light brown well sorted fine
to medium grained quartzarenite . Grain size analysis ( Table 1 ) demonstrates that the
sediment is of medium size and on the boundary between well sorted and moderately
well sorted categories . The majority of the sample is poorly lithified and

consequently very friable . Occasional very thin ( 41mm ) slightly silty laminae outline
cross bedding at between 10 and 20 degrees to a plane perpendicular to the core axis .
These laminae show marginally better lithification than the majority of the sample .

The grains are dominated by quartz with minor amounts of pink feldspar and trace
amounts of black heavy mincrals and pale lime green ? glauconite .

Cross cutting the core sample at a high angle approximately 57 degrees to a plane
perpendicular to the core axis is a pronounced offwhite relatively well cemented
tight streak from 12 to 18 mm wide . There is a weak lamination within the zone
parallel to the margins of the streak . Grains within this zone are rimmed and coated
by a white cement . The tight zone shows no reaction to 1096 HCI 1:1 HCI or
concentrated hydrochloric acid . This discounts the cement being any form of
carbonate . Although the porosity of this zone is much reduced when compared to the
bulk of the sample there is still some remnant porosity indicated by the absorption of
the test reagents .

A thin ( 0.51mm ) rind of pinkish discolouration ( possibly hematitic ) occurs along the
margins of the tight zone within the friable quartzarenite .

Individual grains from the friable portion of the sample are relatively well sorted with
the majority of grains being of medium size . Typically quartz grains are subangular
to subrounded with dull surface features . A few grains are subrounded to rounded
with varying but noticeable degrees of polish ( Fig . 13 ) .

Micro description

Three thin sections were prepared at different orientations through this sample .

a ) Tight zone

Two thin sections of the tight zone clearly show it to be a fault ( Fig . 14 ) . Grain size is
bimodal varying from coarse silt to medium sand with a predominance of these end

where chips were broken and rotated away from the grain to becomee silt sized rock
flour . The splitting and cracking of grains has created some porosity which remains
unhealed . Soft grains such as muscovite have been crushed and streaked between
the more competent framework quartz grains . Plagioclase and microcline are more
easily comminuted than the quartz grains .

Both quariz and clay act as cement in this zone . The authigenic quartz overgrowths
predate fracturing . This is evident from the fact that overgrowths have been broken
up along with the main framework grains . Booklets of kaolin infill much of the
original porosity and surround chips of the more finely comminuted material . The
clay also heals some but not all of the fractured grains . Average clay booklet size
is 0.025mm in diameter . Much of the clay precipitation postdates fracturing although
there is smearing of some clay suggesting movement contemporaneous with kaolin
precipitation .

There is a paucity of opaque heavy minerals in this zone when compared to the hand
specimen . It is possible that fluid movement along the fracture zone has dissolved the
iron . rich opaques which precipitate as finely divided hematite seen along the margins
of the zone .

Porosity reduction in of this zone when compared to the sample as a whole is mainly
the result of crushing and compaction . The remaining porosity is dominantly primary
intergranular ( 896 ) fracture porosity ( 396 ) and secondary dissolution porosity ( 196 ) .
Scalloped margins on many of the quartz grains suggest some chemical corrosion .
Several of the larger feldspar grains show partial dissolution to create secondary
porosity .

Visual estimates of the composition are :

Framework quartz 57Fo
feldspar 870
muscovite 19o
chert 276
opaques trace

Cements quartz overgrowths 590
kaolin 1596

Porosity 1296

The second slide cut in the direction of the fracture shows only 2396 porosity due to
the high proportion of crushed material .

In summary the tight streak at a high angle to the bedding seen in hand specimen is
a fault zone . Fracturing and crushing of the framework grains has created a silt sized
rock flour which considerably reduces the porosity of the zone . Cementation by
kaolin has further reduced porosity and made the zone far less friable than the bulk of
the sample . The zone is a partial permeability barrier allowing limited fluid
movement .

b ) Bulk sample

A wellsorted subfeldsarenite with fine to medium sized grains which are subangular
to subrounded and moderately to highly spherical . Grain contacts vary from floating
to tangential .

Primary intergranular porosity is 21.796 ( Fig . 15 ) with minor secondary porosity
( 49c ) resulting from fracturing and partial dissolution of feldspar and mica .

Quartz displays a variety of forms including polycrystalline grains and has a slightly
higher abundance than in other samples ( 56.79b Table 2 ) . Grains display vacuoles
inclusions and undulose extinction . Dust rims show overgrowths in optical continuity
with originally rounded or euhedral quartz grains ( Fig . 16 ) . Figure 16 also illustrates

how the overgrowths are commonly slightly rounded implying reworking . Quartz
overgrowths constitute 2.796 of the point count ( Table 2 ) which is highest of all
samples . Microcline is the most common feldspar . Some grains have jagged adularia
overgrowths which occasionally form an obvious unaltered rim to a illitized feldspar .
Feldspars often show dissolution along cleavage thus producing secondary porosity .
Lithics include chert and metamorphics ( strained polycrystalline quartz and oriented
mica ) . Biotite and muscovite which have been bent during compaction and detrital
accessories and organics are sparse . Hydrocarbon staining is evident . One grain of
carbonate was seen .

Clay content is minor including illite and chlorite . Illite outlines the feldspar
cleavage and is rarely intergrown with chlorite . Most clay occurs as grain
replacement .

Xray diffraction
a ) Tight zone

Quartz is dominant with trace amounts of microcline and sylvite ( Fig . 17 ) . The
bencfit of running an XRD trace can be seen when this trace is compared with the
earlier description of this zone . An estimated 1596 kaolinite was noted in that report
but the XRD trace suggests that much of that material was misidentified . Re
evaluation of the slide shows that much of the misidentified material is in fact very
finely crushed quartz and microcrystalline quartz cement .

b ) Bulk sample

Quartz is dominant with trace amounts of microcline sylvite ( from drilling mud ) and
ankerite ( Fig . 18 ) .

Scanning electron microscopy

The bulk sample is weakly consolidated with primary porosity dominant . Pore
diameters vary from 5 to 20 microns which is consistent with the coarser grain size of
this sample and pore throats are 2 to 5 microns in diameter ( Fig . 19 ) . Grain contacts
are minimal and meniscus quartz cement is responsible for the limited consolidation
( Fig . 20 ) .

Micro description

A moderately well sorted fine to medium grained subfeldsarenite . Grains are
generally subangular to subrounded very loosely cemented and have tangential
contacts occasionally straight due to overgrowths .

Porosity and permeability are excellent ( Fig . 22 ) . Porosity is dominantly primary

intergranular ( 22.396 ) with rare microporosity associated with kaolin and alteration

of feldspars and micas . Secondary porosity totals 296 . A slight reduction in porosity

has resulted from quartz overgrowths which constitute 1.396 of the point count in
able 2 .

Some quartz grains show overgrowths evident from the dust rim of the original grain .
Quartz sometimes displays undulose extinction biotite inclusions vacuole trains dust
rims polycrystalline forms and minor corrosion by siderite . Several types of feldspar
occur in the sample with varying degrees of alteration to illite . Feldspars tend to
occur as lath shaped cleavage fragments but are sometimes difficult to distinguish
from quartz when unaltered . Minerals present in minor proportions include
muscovite rare biotite opaques iron rich lithics and chert . Matrix traces Contain rare
chlorite . Siderite rhombohedra in pore spaces corrode and follow grain boundaries of
framework grains and overgrowths ( Figs . 2324 ) . Carbonate spar constitutes 4.396 of
the sample which is the equal highest abundance in the sample suite ( Table 2 ) . A
micritic phase occurs rarely .

The minor amounts of clay present including illite and kaolin traces and an iron rich
alteration product have little effect on porosity . Illitemuscovite occurs mainly in
altered grains or matrix .

Xray diffraction

Quartz is dominant and a strong sylvite peak indicates considerable drilling mud
invasion into the sample . Siderite microcline and kaolinite are present in trace
amounts . The broad background hump under the dominant quartz and sylvite peaks
can also be attributed to amorphous materials in the drilling mud ( Fig . 25 ) .

Scanning electron microscopy

High proportion of primary porosity with rare secondary oversized pores ( Fig . 26 ) .
Average intergranular pore diameter is 5 to 10 microns with pore throats of less than 4
microns . Partial dissolution of microcline has created some microporosity ( Figs .
2728 ) . Subhedral to euhedral intergrowths of siderite scalenohedra are the most
abundant cement type with minor euhedral rhombs of ankerite . Cement siratigraphy
indicates that micnitic siderite has altered to spar and then as fluid composition
became more Mg rich ankerite precipitated ( Figs . 29303132 ) . The siderite also
contains trace amounts of Mn ( manganese ) in contrast to other samples where the
siderite is calcium rich . The proportion of carbonate cement in this sample is higher
than any of the other core plugs examined . Microcrystalline quartz ( Fig . 33 ) also
occurs as a cement preferentially coating selected grains adjacent to pores . Micas are
evident altering to kaolin .

Macro description

This sample ( 32mm x 36mm diameter ) was taken from the interior of the plug and
drilling mud has apparently only reached one end of the plug and infiltrated less than
a millimewe . The buffcoloured fine to medium sand is well sorted noncalcareous
permeable and poorly lithified . A mean grain size of 0.27 mm ( medium sand ) and
good sorting are indicated in Table 1 . The sample has a strong hydrocarbon smell .

Quariz is dominant with minor feldspars mica and traces of organic matter and
heavy minerals . Liberated quartz grains show frosting ( Fig . 34 ) .

Bedding is revealed by a thin dark brown ( oxidized heavy mineral ? ) layer which
displays soft sediment deformation . Weak bedding is recognized by the presence of
heavy minerals . A straight fracture of 1mm width cuts bedding at 45 degrees and
offsets the main dark brown layer by 12mm . The fracture is filled by brown material
which may be drilling mud .

Micro description

The thin section reveals a well sorted medium grained subfeldsarenite with two
brown bands of moderately sorted fine sand at 40 degrees to each other which
probably represent cross bedding . Brown colouration in the bands is due to silty
matrix hosting siderite crystals . Common illitized feldspars and traces of bitumen
contribute to the colour . Grains are generally subrounded to subangular with the
brown bands containing angular to subangular grains . Many grains are fractured
which probably relates to slide preparation but could indicate a fracture zone .

Primary intergranular porosity is excellent at 2396 ( Table 2 ) and is evident in Figure
35 . Some secondary porosity results from dissolurion ( and fracturing ? ) of grains
( 27 ) . Oversized pores are probably due to plncking during slide preparation .
Porosity ts slightly reduced by quartz and feldspar overgrowths and minor porefilling
clays .

Some quartz shows undulose extinction indicating a probable metamorphic source .
Overgrowths rarely polycrystalline are evident on some grains leading to straight
grain contacts in places . A range of feldspars occur including orthoclase plagioclase
and microcline with adularia overgrowths seen on the latter . A illitized feldspar with
unaltered rim is shown in Figure 36 . Cleavage fragments of feldspar are common . A
scatter of siderile rhombs have grown late in the samples history cementing and
mildly etching some grains and displacing mica . Spar is sometimes seen to surround
aggregations of opaques andor micrite . Table 2 shows the siderite content to be
4.39b the equal highest representation . Other minerals present include muscovite
biotite silty matrix opaques and lithic fragments of chert . Organics abundance is
2.19b Which is the highest of all samples examined ( Table 2 ) .

Illite and kaolin together replace grains and sometimes occur in pores ( Fig . 37 ) . Illite
was seen in an early stage of replacement forming in fedspar cleavages and rarely
totally replacing grains . Browner patches of clay are probably bimwmen stained .

Xray diffraction

Quartz is dominant with minor microcline and siderite . Traces of ankerite kaolinite
muscoviteillite plagioclase and sylvite were detected . The clay peaks are more
pronounced in this sample ( Fig . 38 ) .

Scanning electron microscopy

Intergranular primary porosity is abundant in this subfeldsarenite ( Fig . 39 ) . Average
pore size is 2 to 8 microns with a pore throat diameter of 1 to 2 microns . Microcline
has undergone relatively minor dissolution ( Figs . 4041 ) when compared to samples at
depths of 1397.2m 1402.0m and 1403.5m and therefore does not contribute
significantly to microporosity . Rare feldspars appear completely unaltered .
Microcrystalline quartz ( Fig . 42 ) and siderite scalenohedra ( Fig . 4344 ) represent the
major cement types . Kaolin occurs as an alteration product of biotite ( Figs . 454647 ) .
Release of Fe during this alteration process may have provided the source of Fe
necessary for siderite precipitation .

This small 11mm piece from the end of the 36 mm diameter core pug consists of
fine well sorted friable noncalcareous buffcoloured sand ( Fig . 48 ) . A mean grain

( Table 1 ) .Drilling mud has invaded to a depth of at least Imm . The sample has a
hydrocarbon odour .

Minerals present are dominantly quartz minor muscovite biotite feldspar heavy
minerals and a red mineral .

Bedding is detected by faint heavy mineral laminations .
Micro description

A moderately well sorted medium grained subfeldsarenite ( Fig . 49 ) . The grains
measured for grain size analysis were from a finer grained portion of the
sample.Three bedding planes of fine sand cross the thin section and are moderately
sorted with a higher proportion of low sphericity and subangular grains . They are
thought to be bedding planes . A silty matrix which occludes porosity contains
siderite and hydrocarbon staining . Illitized feldspars are also common in the silty
beds . Some grains are fractured possibly implying movement along these planes .
The relatively impermeable bedding planes would reduce vertical permeability to a
small extent . Between silty beds grains are generally subrounded highly spherical
and well sorted with tangential contacts .

Porosity is excellent between the finer beds due to primary intergranular ( 2396 )
secondary dissolution ( 296 ) and fracture ( 196 ) porosity ( Figs . 5051 ) . A notable
feamore of the slide is the infiltration of yellow hydrocarbon into pores and along
fractures in grains ( Fig . 52 ) .

Quartz is the dominant mineral with examples of composite grains vacuole trains
undulose extinction and mild etching . Brown rims outline some originally euhedral
quartz grains which have since developed anhedral overgrowths ( Figs . 5354 ) . A
single grain shows three episodes of overgrowth the first two in optical continuity
and the last a polycrystalline cement phase ( Figs . 5556 ) . Feldspars occasionally
exhibit overgrowths and secondary porosity is produced by dissolution along
cleavage and microfracturing ( Figs . 5758 ) . Muscovite and biotite are common with
both showing alteration to chlorite . Micas are bent due to compaction and more
abundant in the silty bands . Other constituents include chlorite monazite organics
chert and other lithics . Rhombohedral and scalenohedral siderite spar has precipitated
late in the diagenetic sequence producing minor corrosion of quartz and feldspar
grains and acting as a minor cement ( Figs . 5758 ) . Micritic carbonate is rare .

Some grains have altered to mixed kaolin and illite . A brownish secondary mineral
present may be ironrich illite and other brown inhomogeneous areas particularly in
the silty bands are likely to be hydrocarbon stained matrix . The sample has the
highest measured content of kaolin and muscoviteillite at 6.396 ( Table 2 ) .

Xray diffraction

Quartz is dominant and microcline minor . Traces of siderite ankerite kaolinite
muscoviteillite and sylvite were detected ( Fig . 59 ) .

Scanning electron microscopy

Porosity is dominantly primary in nature in this poorly consolidated sample ( Fig . 60 ) .
Pore size varies from 6 to 12 microns with pore throats of 1 to 2 microns . Microcline
has been etched along crystallographic axes to produce limited microporosity ( Figs .
6162 ) . There is also rare microporosity associated with kaolin formed due to the
alteration of micas ( Figs . 636465 ) . Siderite and microcrystalline quartz are
responsible for cementation . Siderite occurs both as euhedral authigenic crystals
( Figs . 6667 ) and subhedral rounded rhombohedra ( Figs . 6869 ) . The latter suggests
either some siderite precipitated under less ideal conditions or has undergone
subsequent dissolution . Both scenarios demonstrate that there may have been several
phases of growth . One fracture within a rounded siderite crystal is partially infilled
with microcrystalline quartz indicating that quartz postdates this phase of siderite .

mm ) and moderately well sorted .

Mineral constituents include quartz ( dominant ) feldspar muscovite biotite and lithic
fragments ( Fig . 70 ) .

Bedding is revealed by alignment of micas and heavy minerals . A minor fracture

Micro description

A moderately well sorted very fine to fine grained subfeldsarenite ( Fig . 71 ) . Grains
are angular to subangular and of low to moderate sphericity with a few rounded
medium sized grains Angular grains include cleavage fragments and fractured
grains : Very few grains are floating most have tangential to slightly sutured contacts .
Compaction is also shown by distorted micas and squeezed matrix .

Primary intergranular porosity is good . Secondary porosity occurs in fractures and
where grains and overgrowths have been partially dissolved . There is a higher
relative contribution of secondary porosity in this sample ( 9.396 Table 2 ) . Micro
porosity is associated with illite . Some fractures are healed but the fracture porosity
of 4.39b is the highest of all samples . Porosity has been reduced by feldspar
overgrowths and claymatrix in parts of the sample . A few oversized pores probably
relate to slide preparation rather than dissolution .

Quartz is again dominant and unstrained to mildly strained with lines of vacuoles and
some fractures . It is likely to have igneous and metamorphic origins . Dust rims
outline some original grain boundaries . Feldspar varieties include microcline
orthoclase perthites and plagioclase . Cleavage fragments are common and
overgrowths sometimes evident . Rare grains show an unaltered adularia rim to a
illiized feldspar or dissolution along perthitic cleavage . Figures 72 and 73
demonstrate dissolution along feldspar cleavage . One example of granophyric
intergrowth with quartz was seen . Traces of bent muscovite and biotite occur ( Figs .
7213 ) the latter undergoing alteration to chlorite with the consequent release of iron .
Other minerals include zircon a green mineral ( glauconite ? ) chert and lithics of
probable volcanic origin ( dusty altered devitrified glass ? ) . Areas of siderite spar
cement have some associated corrosion where carbonate is progressing into the
sample but no dissolution has occurred .

Illitization of plagioclase and volcanic grains is intense microcline and orthoclase
show incipient alteration . Dlitic clays have been squashed between framework grains
and kaolin is rare . Dark brown silty matrix and possibly drilling mud occur in places .
Xray diffraction

Quartz is dominant and microcline subdominant . The strength of the sylvite peak

implies moderate contamination . Siderite muscoviteillite and kaolinite occur in
trace amounts ( Fig . 74 ) .

Good intergranular porosity is evident with pore diameters of 4 to 12 microns ( Fig .
75 ) and pore throats varying in diameter between 1 and 3 microns . Micro and
secondary porosity are better developed in this sample than any other specimen due to
the intense dissolution of feldspars . Some feldspars remain only in a skeletal form
( Fig . 7677 ) . Microcrystalline quartz occurs as a cement ( Fig . 78 ) between detrital
grains . Siderite is present as subhedral rhormbohedra ( Fig . 7980 ) similar to those
observed in core plug # 22 . Intergrowths of these crystals clearly indicate
development in situ .

Complete coverage of the interval 1360 1437m was provided with the following
logs :

Bit size

Caliper

Gamma ray

SP

MSFL

LLS

LLD

Sonic ( normal and long )
Neutron porosity
Density
Photoelectric effect

All the petrographic samples came from the main reservoir interval 1395.4 1410.0
metres . The logs show good porosity in the order of 253096 which was confirmed by
the point count results . Fair to good permeability is suggested by the separation of the
resistivity logs and the occurrence of mud cake buildup over most of the sands .

Of particular interest are the spikes on the MSFL curve . These suggest increased
cementation and many of them line up with spikes on other curves confirming this
suggestion . The most prominent occurs at 1414 metres within a subsidiary reservoir
sand . There are similar but lower peaks at 1395.2m and 1399.0m . Correspondence of
the medium and deep resistivity peaks sonic peak and Pef pcak strongly suggest
cementation of these zones by a mineral with the sum of elemental atomic numbers
greater than that of silica . This includes all of the carbonates . Siderite was the
dominant carbonate in all of the samples investigated and is the most likely cement
for these zones . Even a small amount of siderite will give rise to a noticeable Pef
peak . ( Note that all the Pef values are raised by about 0.5 of a unit probably due to
doping by barite mud . Mud contamination was picked up on all of the XRD traces by
a peak . ) .

The overall effect in the main reservoir is likely to be minimal . The thin sands
interbedded with shales are those most affected by siderite cement . This is to be
expected if the source of both iron and carbonate is from the adjacent shales .

The inference is that the thin sands immediately below the main reservoir may not
contribute substantially to the recoverable reserves in the area because of the lower
porosity and permeability and the possible occurrence of tight zones parallel to
bedding .

7 . CONCLUSIONS

All the samples investigated are similar petrographically . They are clean sandstones
with waces of bedding and cross bedding outlined by thin slightly silty laminae and
thin bands where traces of heavy minerals are concentrated . The similarity of all the
samples is due largely to the close stratigraphic proximity as well as the same source
area depositional and diagenetic history .

Grain size analyses show very little variation between samples with the average size
of each near the fine to medium sand boundary . The sorting of cach sample is
berween moderately well sorted and well sorted sand . This indicates reasonable
textural maturity although the subangular to subrounded character of the majority of
the grains suggests only moderate textural maturity .

Provenance of the sediment is complex . The dominant original source of the
sediment appears to have been from an igneous terrain with rare metamorphic and
minor volcanic input . Many of the quartz grains have igncous features such as
vacuole trails and low strain indications . The metamorphic grains are mainly
polycrystalline and highly strained . The few volcanic grains are highly altered and
have the appearance of devitrified glass . The relatively high feldspar content 101696
determined by point count ( mainly orthoclase and microcline ) suggests an acid
igneous source area . Rounding of early stages of quartz overgrowth indicates that a
minor proportion of the grains have been inherited ie . reworked from an earlier
ment .

The feldspar content when recalculated to account for only the solid part of the rock
ranges from 12229c which classifies all samples as subfeldsarenites . This indicates
only a moderate chemical maturity in line with the textural maturity indicated by the
Toundness characteristics .

Many of the feldspar grains have been altered and partly dissolved . The more
reactive plagioclase grains show extensive alteration to illite and minor kaolin . The
Jess reactive K feldspars are incipiently illitized which shows as dense brown dusty
inclusions in plane polarized light . This alteration may have started in the source
rock perhaps hydrothermally but has continued in the sediment diagenetically . In
SEM it is evident that K feldspars are preferentially dissolving along preferred
crystallographic axes . This dissolution is particularly pronounced in core plug 26A .

Compactional effects were seen in all samples . These include the bending of mica
flakes and the tangential to slightly sutured contacts between the framework grains .
Small areas of most sections show muddy matrix andor clay cement which surrounds
several grains . This effect may be due to squeezing of mud clasts or highly altered
grains by compaction to fill the adjacent pore spaces or may be drilling mud
contamination .

All samples are particularly friable indicating a lack of cement . There is weak
cementation by quartz overgrowths . Three stages were seen the first two are
monocrystalline encasing detrital quartz and the final stage occurs as microcrystalline
pore filling and grain coating quartz . Rounding of the first two stages indicates they
were inherited by erosion and reworking of an earlier sediment . Thus despite the
presence of quariz overgrowths the sample remains extremely friable . Minor
amounts of authigenic feldspar overgrowths were also observed . These are probably
adularia and occur on the K feldspars microcline and orthoclase . Trace to minor
amounts of authigenic clay dominantly kaolinite and illite are shown on the XRD
traces . Kaolin was seen replacing mica and some feldspars . Illite also occurs as
feldspar replacement .

The small amount of clay in these samples and the dominance of kaolinite suggests
that it is unlikely that any drilling or production problems will occur from clay
reactions . Indeed no reactive clays were recognized in the course of this study .

Carbonates also contribute to weak cementation . Siderite spar occurs as interstitial
aggregates and as euhedral and subhedral rhombohedra . EDS analysis during SEM
investigations also showed the presence of ankerite . The XRD plots showed small
ankerite peaks in most samples . A complex relationship between the carbonate
phases has been identified through observations in thin section and SEM . The earliest
phases appear to be micritic siderite and ankerite rhombs . The micrite was probably
synsedimentary and the ankerite very early diagenetic . These early thombs have been
rounded and pitted by dissolution . Sparry siderite surrounds the micrite and this too
shows rounding of the rhombs in some cases . The latest stage is euhedral ankerite
the sharp crystal faces of which show no sign of dissolution . The complexity of these
relationships would be reduced if siderite and ankerite were to have coexisted . Some
carbonate does however postdate clay development as seen by its displacive
behaviour in thin section . Furthermore SEM observations indicate that
microcrystalline quartz has precipitated after the early ankerite rhombs .

The carbonate cements have the potential to obliterate the reservoir in some areas and
to enhance porosity in others . These relationships may need to be mapped out in
order to fully exploit the field .

Good sorting moderate compaction and minor amounts of cement have allowed
excellent preservation of primary porosity ranging from 172596 . Added to this is
some secondary porosity dominantly due to dissolution of feldspars but also
including some fracture porosity so that the total porosity measured by point count
ranges from 202796 . This does not include any microporosity associated with kaolin
booklets massed illite or kaolinillite replacement of feldspar . Fracture porosity is
likely to have been induced by faulting as seen in the comminuted portion of the
sample from 1398.2m . Secondary porosity is also enhanced by corrosion of quartz
and feldspar during carbonate emplacement and the subsequent removal of some of
that carbonate .

Moderate rounding of grains combined with the well to moderately well sorted nature
of the sands allows for relatively large pore throats and pore diameters in the original
sediment . Small to moderate amounts of compaction and minimal cement have
allowed the pores to persist near their original size . Observation under SEM shows
that the pore diameters are in the range of 210 microns with occasional oversized
pores to 20 microns . Pore throats in all samples are of the order of 12 microns with
some as large as 5 microns .

The following tentative sequence of diagenetic events has been established for the
samples provided :

1 . Precipitation of micritic siderite
2 . Compaction
3 . Growth of ankerite spar and embaying of framework grains

4 . Dissolution and alteration of feldspar and mica to form kaolinite
and illite

5 . Minor dissolution of carbonate

6 . Overgrowth of authigenic feldspar and microcrystalline quartz
cement

SUMMARY

Challis8 was drilled in MarchApril 1989 to appralse the updip potential
of the C56.1 sand which was intersected below the oilwater contact in
Challis7 . The well intersected a net 36.4 m of oilbearing sand within
the CS6.1 unit . A drill stem test was conducted on the upper part of this
sand to gain information on reservoir characteristics and potential sand
production problems prior to completlon . Surface sampling was also

carried out during the test .

The well exhibited good productivity and flowed at a maximum unstabilised
rate of 7864 bbld against a tubing head pressure of 332 psig during the

sand failure test . No significant sand production was observed .

The minimum pore volume accessed by the well was inferred by the test to
be in the order of 60 MMrbbls . Details of the calculation are given in
Appendix A . As several boundaries and changes in reservoir parameters
Were evident from che test analysis no conclusions can be reached from

the test data regarding the assoclated oil volume .

The pressure behaviour during the test indicated the presence of three
noflow boundaries in the vicinity of the well and an Increase in

transmissibility away from the wellbore .

The initial reservoir pressure was within 4 6 psi of the average reservoir
pressure derived from the previous wells . The oilwater contact derived
from electric logs was 1412.5 m TVD ss whereas the contact was estimated
to be at 1410 m TVD ss from the RFT data . These figures compare
reasonably well with the common Challis field contact depth of
1410.5 m TVD ss inferred from earlier wells .

SONGLUSIONS

The minimum reservoir pore volume accessed by Challis8 is in the
order of 60 MMrbbl . The pressure response shows evidence of several

boundaries and changes in transmissibility within the radius of

investigation and accordingly no firm conclusions are possible xx

regarding the oil volume accessed by the well .

The above estimate was made from the difference between the inltial
reservoir pressure and the final pressure measured at the end of the
main buildup . As the Horner plot was still trending upwards at the
end of the buildup it is likely that the volume accessed by the
well is greater than this . It should be noted here that based on
geological correlations across the Challis and Cassini fields the
total reservoir pore volume of the CS6.1 sand is estimated to be in
excess of 1 billion bbl .

The formation permeability adjacent to the wellbore was 731 md
assuming only the top 19.5 m of the CS6.1 unit to be in direct

communication with the well .

The apparent skin factor was 0.6 . When corrected for partial
penetration effects the mechanical skin factor was approximately
0.8 .

The pressure response observed during the test indicated the presence
of three noflow boundaries in the reservoir as well as an increase
in transmissibility away from the well . The best match using
analytical simulation was obtained with the well approximately midway
between two parallel faults 83 n apart with a third noflow boundary
some 700 m from the well and a constantpressure boundary
representing an increase in transmissibility 109 m in the opposite
direction . This interpretation assumes that only the top part of the
C56.1 unit is in communication with the well .

The unstabilised productivity index measured at the end of the main
flow period was 43.3 bbldpsi at the end of the sand production
test flow period the unstabilised PI was 49.6 bbldpsi .

The tide corrected initial reservoir pressure at the top of
perforatlons was between 2027.9 and 2035.9 psia at 1393.5 m AH KB .
Reservoir temperature at this depth was 67 ? C . The initial reservoir
pressure corrected to reservoir datum was between 2072.5 and 2080.6
psia at 1410.5 m ss which is in good agreement with the average
reservoir pressure of 2078 psia at the same depth derived from

previous wells .
No significant sand or water was produced .

The separator gas o11 ratio of 197 scfbbl was lower than that
abserved in other Challis wells . This is consistent with a
previously observed trend of decreasing GOR across the fleld from

west to east .

Finite difference reservoir simulation would be required if it is
intended to reconcile the test results with the geological and

geophysical mapping of this part of the Challis field .

INTRODUCTION

Chellis8 was drilled in ACL3 in MarchApril 1989 to aeppraise the
updip potential of the CS6.1 sand intersected below the oilwater
contact in Challis7 . The well intersected 36.4 m of net permeable
sand within the CS6.1 unit and proved up significant additional
reserves in the field .

Log and core data showed the CS6.1 sand to be well developed with
an average porosity of 26.2 per cent over the net pay interval
( Reference 1 ) . The average core permeability to air was 1359 md at
reservoir conditions over the interval 1396.0 to 1404.1 m AH KB

( Reference 2 ) .
The objectives of testing Challis8 were as follows :

1 . To ascertain well productivity permeability skin factor
and the potential of the CS6.1 reservoir .

2 . To determine the presence of reservoir boundaries in the
vicinity of Che well .

3 . To confirm the reservoir pressure in the CS6.1 sand .

4 . To obtain information about any potentlal sand production
problems by means of a short high flow rate high drawdown

test after the main test had been concluded .
5 . To obtain representative samples of formation fluids .

The programme was modified initially due to problems encountered
during the unsuccessful latching of the SRO Gauge and subsequently
because of a cyclone alert . The main flow period was shortened from
24 hours to 15 hours 48 minutes whilst the buildup period was
extended from 48 hours to 60 hours 50 minutes . As the string had
been circulated to completion brine only half an hour after the start
of the main buildup the programme was extended to include another
short buildup after che sand production test . Subsequently when
the gauges were recovered from the well it was found that the well

suspension operations had not affected the gauge data .

-----Page 193-----

As a result of these revisions che test outline was as follows :

underbalanced perforation of the interval 1393.5 1409.5
m AH KB using 5 TCP guns at 12 SPF with the well open
followed by a 10 minute initial flow of 3 bbl .

1 hour 17 minute of initial buildup with the well shutin
at the LPRN .

6 hours 34 minutes running the SRO pressure gauge and
atcempting to latch without success ( SRO was therefore not
available ) .

15 hour 48 minute main flow with the laac 9 hours 28 minutes
on a 4864 positive choke and an average flovrate of 4400
bbld over the last hour of flow and a final flowing tubing
head pressure of 501 pasig .

60 hour 50 minute main buildup with the well shutin at
the LPRN and OMNI .

2 hours circulating the string to diesel and cycling the
OMNI to test position .

4 hour sand production test with che last 2 hours 15 minutes
on a 12864 positive choke and an average flowrate of 7856

bbld over the last hour of flov .

4 hour final buildup .

This report contains a detailed analysis of the test including a
review of operatlonal problems data quality tide corrections and

reservoir characteristics .

A summary of the test results is shown in Table 1 .

N.B .

All depths are measured relacive to the kelly bushing ( KB )
of the Sedco 708 which is 26.0 m above sea level . The well
was vertical and hence no corrections to true vertical depth

were required .

3 . TESI DATA

3.1 Flowing History and Sequence of Events

The test string was run in the hole without problems and the RTTS
packer was set after an initial depth correlation run had been made .
The final depth correlation log showed the guns to be 0.5 m deep to
the programme . After circulating the string to diesel to give an
underbalance of over 300 psi the interval 1393.51409.5 m AH KB
( programme 13931409 m AH KB ) was perforated using 5 TCP guns at 12
SPF fired by a drop bar system with the well open to surface on a
2464 choke .

During the initial flow perlod 3 barrels of diesel flowed to the
gauge tank production rates were derived from tank volumes . The
well wag then shutin for the initial buildup . After one hour
the SRO gauge was rigged up and run in the hole but repeated
attempts to latch the tool into the Otis Evalve were unsuccessful .
The tool either released under overpull or when the well was opened
to flow possibly because of some perforatlon debris in the test
string . Problems were also experienced opening the LPRN at this
stage . Eventually it was decided to proceed without the SRO gauge

in order to avold further loss of rig time .

When opening the LPRN for the main flow period an annulus pressure
of 2000 psi was required compared to a design pressure of 1500 psi .
Subsequent examination of the pressure buildup data indicated that
the LPRN was probably leaking for the first few minutes of each
shutin perlod ( see Section 4.6.2 ) although the main buildup data
was not affected by this problem because a good downhole seal was
provided by the OMNI valve as discussed belov .

For the first 2 hours 47 minutes of the main flow period the well
was flowed directly to the flare to allow it to clean up during this
time the production rate was estimated from the bottom hole
pressure using the productivity index measured later in the flow
period . Two mecter calibration checks were carried out soon after
flow was diverted to the separator the first check gave a low
figure but the second check vas within 5 per cent of the factory
calibration . A partial blockage of the choke occurred shortly after

-----Page 195-----

3.2

3.3

this but was cleared by increasing the choke size for a short time .
Three sets of separator samples were collected during the main flow

period .

A cyclone alert a few hours later led to a reduction of the flowing
time from 24 hours to 15 hours 48 minutes . Half an hour after
shuttingin downhole the well was circulated to completion brine and

the rig was then evacuated .

On return to the rig the string was circulated to diesel and the
well opened for a four hour high flow rate test . The test programme
was then extended to incorporate a4 further four hour buildup
because of concern that insufficient data had been collected during
the main buildup due to the killing operations . When the DST string
was recovered it was found that the OMNI valve had moved into the
blank position when the LPRN was first closed and so the bottom hole

pressure data was not affected by the operations above .

When the RTTS packer was released 200 barrels of completion brine
were lost to the formation . Damage caused by this brine may account
for the reduced PI and increased skin ( 42.5 ) measured during

completion testing .
A sumaary of the flow perlods is contained in Table 2 and plotted
in Figure 1 . Surface data was recorded using the Otis ODAS system

and full details of choke settings flowrates and surface

temperatures and pressures are included in Reference 3 .

Downhole Pressures and Temperaturas

References 4 5 and 6 contain listings of the raw bottom hole
pressure and temperature data supplied by Otis Halliburton and
Schlumberger respectively . All pressures were tidecorrected prior
to analysis . Tidecorrected pressure data from the Otis HMR gauge

is plotted against time in Figure ! .

Tidal Effects on Pressure . Data

There was clear evidence of tidal effects on the pressure data
especlally at late time in the buildups . Pressure corrections for
tidal effects have been found necessary on previous Challis wells
at a rate of 0.23 psin of tide height with zero tine shift . A
similar correction was applied to the data for Challis8 and
appeared to be approprlate . As the rig was evacuated during the
cyclone alert it was not possible to record tide heights for the
full duration of the test and so BHPP theoretical tide tables which
have proved accurate in the past when compared with measured data

were used instead

-----Page 197-----

4.1 Introduction

Two Otis HMR crystal gauges two Halliburton GRC strain gauges and
two Schlumberger CRG crystal gauges were run in the DST string . A
Schlumberger SRO gauge was also programmed but repeated attempts to
latch into the Otis Evalve were unsuccessful and the test proceeded

without surface readout .

Gauge types and specifications are shown in Tables 46

Reliable data throughout the Cest was only obtained from one of the
HMR gauges alchough one of the Schlumberger gauges recorded until
the end of the main buildup . The gauges are discussed Individually

balow .

SRO gauge and EValve

Although no problems were experienced with the SRO gauge itself it
proved impossible to latch the tool into the Otis Evalve as
discussed in Section 3.1 . A limited amount of shutin pressure data
was abtained while the tool was partially latched . This enabled an
initial reservoir pressure estimate to be made early in the test
operaclans but has not been used in che detailed analysis as
sufficient data was available from the other gauges . It was
eventually decided to proceed without the SRO gauge In order to avoid
further loss of rig time .

Otis HMR Gaugas

Two HMR gauges were run in a gauge carrler located above the RTTS
packer and immediately below the upper drag block assembly . The top
of the carrler was at a depth of 1370.55 m AH KB.and the gauge
measure point was 1.91 m below this ac 1372.46 m AH KB .


-----Page 198-----

10

HMR CF10052 failed during surface pressure testing prlor to running
in the hole no backup gauge was available and so the gauge was run
in despite the failure in case it started working downhole . The
attempt proved unsuccessful . Some problems were experlenced reading
the memory of HMR CF10054 on the wellsite but once the data was
accessed it was found that the gauge had recorded good quality data
throughout the test perlod .

Schlumberger CRG Memory Gauges

The Schlumberger gauge carrier was located below the TCP guns with
the top at a depth of 1413.16 m AH KB . The gauge measure point was
5.83 m below this at 1418.99 m AH KB .

CRGC 8044 started recording on time at 06:40 on 6th April but the
compression algorithm failed and as a result the memory was full 2
hours and 25 minutes later . Furthermore the recorded pressure was

too high and erratic .

CRGC 8045 recorded without problems from 06:11 on 16th April until
the memory was full at 00:45 on 20th April just after the start of

the sand failure test .

Halliburton GRC Gauges

Two Halliburton GRC strain gauges were run on this test in order to
compare their performance with the Schlumberger SDP gauges . They
were loaded in the HMR carrier and their measure point was 0.16 m
lower than the HMR measure point . Gauge No . 71678 recorded
throughout the test but readings were consistently low to those of
the HMR gauge ranging from a discrepancy of 38 psi at the start of
the test to 33 psi at the end . No data was supplled by Halliburton
for the other GRC gauge ( No . 73003 ) nor was any explanation offered

for the gauge failure .

After repeated enquiries Halliburton responded in late October 1989
( Reference 5 ) and supplied recalibrated data for gauge No . 71678 .
The data was shifted by a constant tr 35 psi and so the drift of t
5 psi ( approximately ) during the test was still evident . The reason

-----Page 199-----

.11

for the failure of the other gauge remained unknown . It had been
tested on surface end no fault was found but subsequently failed
downhole on another job .

Calibration accuracy reliability and service would all have to
improve before these gauges with their much larger memory capacity

could be recommended over the Schlumberger strain gauges .

Horner plots of the initial buildups for gauges HMR CF10054
and CRGC 8045 are attached as Figures 5 and 6 . The late
time data has been extrapolated for both gauges to give the
initlal reservoir pressures shown in Table 7 . As can be seen
from the table after depth corrections under a range of
assumptions regarding the fluids in the wellbore the two
gauges agree within 23 psi . The derivation of initial
reservoir pressure and the approach to depth corrections

1s covered in more detail in Section 5 .

4.6.2 Main Buildup

Figure 7 1s a Horner plot of the main buildup showing data
from both the CRG and HMR gauges . An adjustment of minus
53.3 psi has been applied to the CRG data in order to correct
for the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the two
gauges assuming 100 per cent o11 down to the base of the
perforations and 100 per cent completion brine below this .
As can be seen in che figure the two gauges have a
consistent response with the CRG gauge reading 2.5 to 3.0
psi higher than the HMR gauge after hydrostatic correction .

-----Page 200-----

12

INITIAL RESERVOIR PRESSURE

The initial reservoir pressures was determined by the extrapolation
of Horner plots of the initial buildup using data from HMR CF10054
( Figure 5 ) and CRGC 8045 ( Figure 6 ) . The ridecorrected
extrapolated pressure from the HMR gauge is 2008.2 psia act a depth
of 1372.46 m AH KB compared cto a final buildup pressure of 2006.82
psia recorded at 11:12:43 just before the swab valve was opened to
run the SRO gauge into the hole . The corresponding data for the CRG
gauge were an extrapolated pressure of 2069.7 psia at a depth of
1418.99 m AH KB and a final buildup pressure of 2069.25 psia at
11:12:34 .

Only 3 bbl of diesel were recovered from the well during the initial
flow period . The volune of the wellbore between the base of
perforatLlons and the LPRN wes 5.9 bbl : this was filled with 1.13 SG
completion brine before perforating . As shown in Table 7 depth
corrections from the gauges to the top of perforatlons were applied
assuming initially that there was 1008 brine below the base of
perforatlons and a mixture of oil and brine above and then that che
o11 and brine were completely separated with the fluid interface in
the wellbore at 1391.4 m AH KB . All the calculations assuned chat
the 3 bbl of diesel recovered at surface had been replaced by the
same volume of oil from the reservoir . Depth corrections from the
top of the perforations to the reservoir datum of 1410.5 m ss were
applled at the oil gradient of 1.038 psim .

The tidecorrected reservoir pressures at the reservoir datum of
1410.5 m ss varied between 2072.5 to 2080.6 psia . This seems to be
in good agreement with the initial reservoir pressure of 2078 psia

derived from earlier wells .

ANALYSIS OF TEST DATA

All che detailed analysis below has been carried out using the data
from HMR gauge CF10054 unless otherwise specified . It was not
considered necessary to duplicate the analysis with the CRG gauge in
view of the consistent response between the gauges discussed in
Section 4.6.2 .

Initial Buildup Analysis

The shape of the initial buildup Horner plot ( Figure 5 ) and loglog
ploc ( Figure 8 ) suggest that a Horner straight line was not reached
uncil several minutes after shuttingin the well and lasted for a
short time only . The shape of the early line is indicative of
continually changing wellbore storage this is discussed in more
detail in Section 6.2 below . In view of the expected presence of
reservoir boundaries close to the well and the very short period of
the possible radial flow period it was not considered appropriate
to analyse this buildup for permeability and skin factor .

At later time the slope of the Horner plot increases steeply due
ta gravity segregation of fluids in the wellbore as confirmed by the
flatter response of the CRG gauge ( Figure 6 ) which was below the

perforatlons .

Main Butldup Analysig

The shape of the main buildup curves is markedly different to those
of the initial buildup . The loglog plot ( Figure 9 ) shows little
evidence of wellbore storage and suggests a Horner straight line
from 14 seconds after shutin until 2 minutes 20 seconds after shut
in . The Horner plot ( Figure 10 ) gives an excellent correlation over
this period . Analysis of this early line gives a transmissibility
of 46770 md ft and hence a permeability of 731 md . The cotal skin
was 0.6 giving a mechanical skin of 0.8 after correction for

partial penetratlon .

During the early and middle period of the buildup the slope of the
Horner line doubles and then nearly redoubles which may indicate
there are two perpendicular faults adjacent to the well ( Reference


-----Page 202-----

14

7 ) . From the intersection times and using the permeabillty from the
early line the nearest fault was estimated co be 25 m from the well
( Figure 11 ) and the other one 51 m away ( Figure 12 ) .

More detailed analysis of this buildup required analytical

simulation which is discussed in the next section .

Analytical Simulation

The WELTEST analytical simulator was now used to obtain a best fit
to the data . In view of the problems encountered with the initial
and sand tesc buildups ( see Section 7.1 ) the analysis was
concentrated on the main buildup perlod . Due to the complexity of
the reservoir evident in the shape of the Horner plot at first a

match was only attempted on the early and middle time data .

Convent1onal analysis had indicated the presence of two perpendicular
faults ( Section 6.2 ) and so the first approach was to match a model
with two intersecting faults to the dara for the first 3 hours 54
minutes of the buildup . The match obtained was good ( Figure 13 )
and showed an intersection angle of 99 degrees with a distance to

the nearest fault of 34 m and to the intersection point of 59 m .

The best match with two parallel faults during the same time interval
was not as good ( Figure 14 ) showing a continuous increase in slope
not evident in the data . Distance to the nearest boundary was 23 m

and to the other one 68 nm .

The match perlod was nov extended to include all the data except for
the final increase in slope on the Horner plot and a third boundary
added . Distances to all boundaries were allowed to float . With two
perpendilcular faults and a constant pressure boundary a reasonable

match was obtailned ( Figure 15 ) with distances as follows :

Distance to Top NoFlow Boundary 30m
Distance to Right NoFlow Boundary 72m
Distance to Bottom ConstantPressure Boundary 207 m

Overall the match improved when two parallel faults were modelled

with a constant pressure boundary as shown in Figure 16 . Distances

-----Page 203-----

15 1
to the varlous boundaries were :

Distance to Top NoFlow Boundary 41 m

Distance to Bottom NoFlow Boundary 42m
Distance to Left ConstantPressure Boundary m 107m

Now all the buildup data was included and a fourth boundary added .
Initial attempts at matching the data were unsuccessful with
nonconverging solutions or overlays inferlor to the threeboundary
models . Finally what 1s considered to be the best possible
analytical solution to the problem was reached by fixing the
positions of three noflow boundaries representing two parallel
faults and the erosional edge of the upper part of the sand at the
unconformity the distance to the constant pressure boundary was
allowed to float . Distances to the two faults were taken from the
match of the early data shown in Figure 16 and the distance to the
erosional edge from the geological model discussed in Section 6.64
below . This model estimated a distance to the unconformity of 850
m : the best match was eventually obtained with a distance of 701 m .
The match was best with a constant pressure boundary 109 m in the
other direction ( Figure 17 ) . To summarise the boundaries in the

bestfit analytical model were located as below :

Distance to Top NoFlow Boundary 41m
Distance to Right NoFlow Boundary 42m
Distance to Bottom NoFlow Boundary m. B50m
Distance to Left ConstantPressure Boundary m 109m

The use of a constant pressure boundary in the matching process does
noc imply that in practice there is such a boundary in the reservoir .
This technique 1s used because the analytical simulator can not model
an increase in transmissibility and so a constant pressure boundary
1s used as an approximation . Hence the conclusion is reached that
as well as three noflow boundaries there is an increase in
transmissibility in the reservoir approximately 109 m from the well .
This may be due to communication around the end of a fault a general
improvement in permeability or noncontinuity of the shale streaks
seen in the wellbore allowing the perforated interval access to a

greater thickness of the CS6.1 sand .

-----Page 204-----

16
The results of the test analysis are summarised in Table 1 .

Comparisons with Geological and Geophysical Interpretation

Geological correlationg across the Challis field indicate that the
main CS6.1 oilbearing sand tested in Challis8 is below the
ollwater contact in Challis7 850 m to che southwest and in all
the other Challis wells . In the region of Challis8 the two major
bounding faults are mapped approximately 560 m apart with a minor
parallel fault downthrown to the north only 20 m north of the well .
The upper part of the CS6.1 sand tested during the DST and
subsequently completed is interpreted as sealing against the Base
Cretaceous unconformity at an average distance of 850 m east of the
well . Based on this interpretation the Proven plus Probable oil in
place accessed by Challis8 in the whole of the CS6.1 sand has been
estimated at 37.8 MMbbl ( Reference 8 ) . The known aquifer volume in
the sand is at least forty times the oll in place or approximately
1.5 billion bbl . This estimate is based on geological correlations
which indicate the sand was seen as far away as Cassini12 12 km west
of Challis8 . It is expected to extend considerably further than
this . Figure 18 is a structure contour map of the Base Cretaceous
unconformity showing the eroslonal edges of the main reservolr sands
which make up the Challis field .

As discussed in Section 6.3 some aspects of the test Interpretation
have been based on the geological model in particular the distance
to the unconformity . There is sufficient uncertainty in the seismic
interpretatlon to explain the discrepancy between the mapped distance
of 20 m to the nearest fault and the best match in the analysis of
41 m. The existence of a parallel noflow boundary only 42 m from
the well does however seem to be at odds with the current geophysical
interpretation . There is some suggestion on seismic line HJ6783
which passes through the well and adjacent line HJ4487 of a minor
fault to the south some 100 m from the well but this appears : to be
downthrown to the north and accordingly would be unlikely to act as
a seal . Furthermore this anomaly is not seen on any other lines .
Additional seismic data is currently being obtained for this part of
the Challis field . Once this data is processed the structural
model should be reviewed taking the DST interpretatlon into account .

-----Page 205-----

17

The increase in transmissibility modelled as a constant pressure
boundary 109 m from the well may be explained in several ways from
the geological interpretation . Communication may be occurring around
the end of one of the adjacent faults or the lateral extent of one
or more of the shale streaks seen in the well may have been reached .
There will also be a change in transmissibility across the oilwater
contact although this 1s most unlikely to be seen within the radius
of investigation of the test .

Finite difference reservoir simulation would be required in order to
assess a wider range of possible reservoir configurations consistent

with the well test and geological and geophysical data .

-----Page 206-----

18

The loglog plot of the sand test buildup ( Figure 19 ) shows a marked
similarity to the initial buildup ( Figure 8 ) at early time . The
first possible Horner straight line does not start until 5.6 minutes
after shuttingin the well . This is well beyond the end of the first
true Horner line seen in the main buildup ( Figure 10 ) . The only
known difference between the main buildup and the other two is that
both the OMNI and the LPRN were closed from the start of the main
buildup due to the cycling of the OMNI that occurred while
attempting to latch the SRO gauge . Thus it would appear that the
LPRN was leaking for the first few minutes of every shutin and the
OMNI acted as an effective downhole shutin tool during the main
buildup .

The Horner plot of the sand test buildup 1s attached as Figure 20 :
once again the similarity co the initial buildup ( Figure 10 ) ac

early cime is evident .

In view of the problems discussed above no analysis was attempted

on the sand test data .

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
Ul Samples

Three subsurface samples together with one set of separator samples ( comprising
three 20 liter gas and one 20 liter oil sample ) were collected from Challis # 8
we11 and forwarded to our laboratory in Perth for analysis .

In order to undertake laboratory testing the 20 liter oil sample was
equilibrated in single phase and a portion transferred to a laboratory storage
cylinder for further analysis . On instructions from BHP Petroleum Pty Ltd. the
subsurface samples were also transferred to laboratory storage cylinders and
the transport cylinders sent to Flopetrol for servicing and return to Darwin .

Quality Checks

For the separator samples the bubble point of the liquid samples and the gas
sample opening pressures were measured at reported separator sampling
temperature . This data is summarized on page three . The bubble points of the
subsurface samples were determined at the reported reservoir temperature . This
data is summarized on page four .

Composition

The composition of the separator liquid was then analysed through heptanes plus
using flashchromatographic techniques . Routine gas chromatography was used to

CL measure the composition of the selected separator gas sample . This compositional
data is presented on page five .

The hydrocarbon composition of the selected subsurface sample was measured
through dodecanes plus using flashchromatographic techniques . This composition
is presented on page six .

Note : The subsurface sample from cylinder 1864 was selected for al further
analysis .

PressureVoume Relations

A known volume of the reservoir fluid was charged to a high pressure visual cel1
and thermally expanded to the reported reservoir temperature of 68.6C . The
fluid was then subjected to a constant composition expansion at 68.6C during
which the bubble point pressure of the reservoir fluid was found to be 1409 psig .
The pressurevolume relations of the fluid were then measured . The volumetric
data and the pressurevolume relation measurements of the fluid can be found on
page seven and eight respectively and 1s graphically depicted on pages fourteen
an een .

Differentlal Vaporization

Upon completion of . the pressurevolume relations measurements the sample was
subjected to a differential pressure depletion . This depletion consisted of
several pressure expansions and constant pressure displacements terminating with
al equilibrium gas phase removed from the cel . During this test the fluid
was found to contain 307 standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of residual o1
for H relative o1 volume of 1.183 barrels of saturated oil per barrel of
residual o1 .

The results of the differential vaporization together with the measured
properties of the evolved gases are presented on page nine and depicted
graphically on pages sixteen through eighteen .

Viscosity

The reservoir fluid was subjected to viscosity measurements over a wide range
of pressures in a rolling bal viscosimeter at 68.6C . The viscosity varied from
a minimum of 0.577 centipoise at saturation pressure of 1409 psig to a maximum
of 1.179 centipoise at atmospheric pressure .

The viscosity of the gas phase at each differential liberation pressure was
calculated using Lee Gonzales Eakin correlations together with the measured
gas phase properties . These viscosity data are tabulated on page ten and shown
in graphic form on page nineteen .

Separator Test

Three single stage separator tests were performed to determine the gaso1 ratio
stock tank oil gravity and formation volume factor . A summary of these tests
is presented on page eleven .

Requested compositional data from the separator tests are reported on pages
twelve and thirteen .
