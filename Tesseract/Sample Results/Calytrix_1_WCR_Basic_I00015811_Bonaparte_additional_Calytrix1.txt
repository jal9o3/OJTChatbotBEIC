Final Drilling Report
2.0 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

The semi submersible MODU Eagle was towed from the Elang West1ST1 well and arrived on
location at 0930 hrs 14th April 1995 .

After anchoring two attempts at spudding proved unsuccessful due to the 36in bit walking and the
rig had to be moved twice . The well was spudded successfully at 0130 hrs 16th April 1995 on the
third attempt using a 26in bit36in holeopener combination .

The 36in hole was drilled from 141m to 172m . The 30in20in casing was run and cemented at 172m
after some difficulty was experienced in finding the 36in hole . Poor visibility and currents were
experienced .

Following the running of the BOPs and pressure testing the 17.5in hole was drilled to 226m where
total losses were experienced . This could not be cured with LCM . Drilling continued to 923m with
no returns . At 923m the pipe became struck . After unsuccessful attempts at freeing it the pipe was
severed at 872m . A sidetrack current plug was set from 776m to 872m . The 13.375in casing was
then run and set at 767m . The shoetrack was drilled out and an LOT was conducted to 1.32 SG
EMW .

The 12.25in sidetrack hole was kicked off from 776m and drilled to section TD of 1374m . Total
losses were experienced at 1061m . Losses were successfully cured with LCM . Following logging
the 9.625in casing was run and set at 1364m .

After drilling out the shoetrack and 8.5in hole to 1379m an FIT was conducted to 2.52 SG EMW .
The 8.5in hole was drilled to TD of 1646m . Logging was then carried out and the well plugged and
abandoned .

The rig was released at 0200 hrs 7in May 1995 .

BASIC DATA
INTRODUCTION

Sixteen sidewall core samples from the BHP Petroleum Calytrix1 well were processed . Organic
yields between 15501572m ranged from low to high ( 0.0360.347 ccgm ) . Samples between
15761631m yielded extremely low to low amounts of organic residue ( 0.0010.079 ccgm ) and
were essentially barren of palynomorphs . Palynomorph concentrations for samples between
15501572m were generally high . The state of preservation of the palynomorphs ranged from
poor to fair . Quantitative distribution of selected taxa are illustrated

on the accompanying Range Chart .

The samples were processed by Laola Pty Ltd in Perth . They reported that ten of the sixteen
sidewall cores exhibited minor to substantial mud penetration ( see below ) . The standard of the
preparations was generally fair to good .

BHPP CALYTRIX 1

General Operations Summary

The Calytrix 1 well was drilled from the semi submersible drilling unit the Attwood Eagle .
Calytrix1 was spudded on 160495 . After backing off the drillstring at 923m the wellwas
plugged back to 776m and sidetracked . Calytrix 1 ( ST ) reached a total depth of 1646m
MDTVD on 010595 . In total the Eagle was on location for the Calytrix 1 well for 23.63
days before being released to Elang 3 .

Anchoring up and rig move was performed with little or no trouble . Calytrix 1 was spudded
with.a 36 bit and hole opener assembly . The seabed was tagged at 138.25m and 36 hole
was drilled to 141m . Due to severe walking of the bit the rig was moved and the well re
spudded . Again the bit walked severely and finally a 26 bit was used with the 36 hole
opener . 36 hole was drilled to 172m and a large hi vis gel pill spotted before rigging up to
run casing . The PGB was run complete with the 30 and 20 casing in a combination string ..
The string was then successfully cemented and the BOP run .

The 20 shoetrack was drilled out with a 1712 insert bit . Drilling with full returns continued
to 234m where total losses occured . After pumping LCM drilling continued with intermittent
returns . At 272m the string was pulled back to 108m and repair work conducted on the
topdrive IBOP . Drilling continued to 860m with no drag . At 884m a dramatic drilling break
occured possibly the top of the Grebe sand and at 923m the pipe became stuck . The pipe was
jarred up 15m while circulating where the kelly hose ruptured . Finally a free point indicator
was run and the pipe backed off on the second attempt . The hole was plugged back to 772m
and 1338 casing run . After drilling out the casing shoe and conducting a leak off test a kick
off assembly was made up with 114 AKO . Hole angle was built to 8.3 degrees by 877m
where drilling continued with a rotary assembly to the casing point at 1374m . Losses occured
intermittently while drilling the 1214 section and were cured with LCM pills . After one
electric logging run the 958 casing was run and cemented without problems .

The 812 section was drilled with 1 tungsten carbide insert bit from 1374m to 1646m . A leak
off test at the 958 casing shoe indicated a fracture pressure of 2.52SG EQMD . At 1572m a
drill break was checked for flow and at 1578m a sample circulated . No shows were detected
and drilling continued to TD at 1646m .

The well was extensively logged without incident all tools running to bottom and all results
good .

Three abandonment plugs were set and the casing and wellhead cut and pulled . Anchors were
racked without problems .

SECTION 1.1 OPERATIONS SUMMARY

The Calytrix 1 4 ST1 well for BHP Petroleum was drilled to 1646m total depth using the Atwood Eagle .

The well was drilled to 884m where after becoming stuck the drillstring was backed off the well sidetracked and
drilled to TD at 1646m . The entire operation on Calytrix 1 consumed 23.63 days . This compares to a planned
16.8 days 6.83 days over AFE . The key nonproductive activities which occurred on the well were :

Sidetrack

Wait on weather

Rig service repairs

Fishing stuck pipe 3

The above amounts to 90.690 of the non productive time .

BHP Drilling Department measured Key Performance Indicators ( KPIs ) on the well were :

Nonproductive time 32.949p Desired Nonproductive time 12.59b
Metresday 69.70 md Desired Metresday 98.0 md

OPERATIONS SUMMARY

1.2 MUD LOGGING OPERATIONS SUMMARY

The Baker Highes Inteq Mudlogging crew provided formation evaluation drilling parameter monitoring and
pressure evaluation services for the Calytrix1 well from spudding until the abandonment plugs for Calytrix 1
Sidetrack 1 were in place . Data was processed and stored using Driilbyte V.2 software and whenever line
quality permitted data was transmitted to BHP in Melbourne . Formation evaluation began in the 17 12
section after the 3020 casing shoe had been set at 172 m. Where available cuttings samples were collected
every 10 m from 172 1374 m and every 5 m from 1375 m to TD at 1646 m. Drilling parameters were closely
watched and any abnormalities relayed to the rig floor and BHP representatives . Hydrocarbon shows were
negligable over the entire well and there was no evidence of overpressure . With the exception of lost
circulation hole conditions were good .

There was total loss of circulation in the 17.5 section from 200 m to 923 m with partial returns at 251 272 m .
Drilling continued with seawater and highvis sweeps . Rates of penetration were high and uncontrolled and at
923 m after penetrating a sandstone at 884 m the drillstring became stuck . Later while working the pipe the
kelly hose burst and circulation ceased while it was replaced . By then the pipe was stuck fast and had to be
backed off at 872 m. The hole was then plugged back to 776 m and 13 38 casing set to 767 m in preparation
for drilling a sidetrack .

The Calytrix1 Sidetrack1 began with 12 14 hole and 1.04 sg prehydrated gel mud . The kickoff assembly
contained an Inteq MWD Directional tool and this in combination with cuttings samples evaluation was used
to recognise when the kickoff had been successful . After building sufficient angle and closure the bit was
pulled to change to a pendulum assembly which drilled to the 9 58 casing point at 1374 m achieving a near
vertical hole . With the majority of the lost circulation zone sealed off behind casing there were only minor
short lived losses to the hole which were cured with LCM pills and continued circulation . .

After wireline logging and setting the 9 58 casing at 1364 m the mud system was changed to 1.15 sg KCI
PHPA mud and drilling proceeded with an 8 12 bit and an Inteq MWD DPR tool . A coring point was
expected at 1452 m but no significant drilling break was encountered until 1572 m. Unfortunately there were
insufficient shows to merit a core and drilling proceeded without incident to TD at 1646 m. There were
occasional very minor losses in the sandstone below 1572 m. The well was monitored throughout the final
logging suites and while the abandonment plugs were being set .

# The automatic satailite tracking system aboard the Atwood Eagle has been faulty for over four months and
finally failed completely on the 28th April . At the time of writing it was being repaired .

OBSERVATIONS

BHPP CALYTRIX 1

The following is a summary of observations made after the drilling of Calytrix 1 .

Bit performance measured as CMI for Calytrix 1 was considerably better than the
historical average . CMI for Calytrix 1 was A5537.86 compared to the historical average
of A5790.7 .

Non productive time was considerably higher than the average at 32.949o compared t to the
historical average of 18.356 .

The well was respudded twice due to severe walking of the spud assembly .

The 17.5 section was drilled using a long toothed tungsten carbide insert bit and average
rates of penetration were high .

Total fluid losses occurred in the 17.5 section from 200m to 923m .

The drillstring became stuck at 923m and was backedoff at 872m despite attempts to jar
free .

The 13.375 casing was set high at 767m to enable a sidetrack .

Prehydrated gel mud was used for the 12.25 section .

The hole was kickedoff using a milled tooth bit and an AKO angle of 1.25 degrees .

The 9.625 casing was run and cemented without incident despite a build and drop
sidetrack section .

CONCLUSIONS

-----Page 119-----

BHPP CALYTRIX 1

The following is a summary of conclusions made after drilling Calytrix 1 .

Non productive time was higher than the historical primarily due to the need to sidetrack
around a fish .

Bit walk while spudding appeared to be exacerbated by the use of a 36 bit rather than a
26 as was used in the successful spud attempt .

A combination of high rates of penetration due to the use of an aggressive insert bit and
poor hole cleaning due to continuous fluid losses led to the bottom hole assembly
becoming stuck .

The annulus was packed off below the jars as evidenced by the jars being able to be fired
and the kelly hose bursting .

The use of controlled drilling and a 150 bbl LCM pill in the 12.25 section reduced losses
considerably and contributed to the stability of the hole while logging and running 9.625
casing .

An additional string of casing was needed to reach required TD .

SECTION 4
RECOMMENDATIONS

-----Page 121-----

BHPP CALYTRIX 1

The following are recommendations for consideration prior to drilling similar wells to Calytrix
1

e A26 bit and 36 hole opener combination should be used for spudding to reduce the
likelyhood of bit walk and the need for respudding .

e Where total losses occur the use of high viscosity pills and sweeps should be increased
and consideration should be given to controlled drilling to reduce the risk of packihg off
the annulus and ultimately losing the bottom hole assembly . Obviously there is a trade off
between maximising metres per day and minimising non productive time .

the 36 hole proceeded to 141 m. Due to severe walking
of the bit it was decided to move the rig 3 m south
before reattempting to spud the well . Once again the bit
walked without spudding and it was decided to pull the
bit and replace it with a 26 bit on the same BHA .

prior to each connection . Once bottom was tagged there
was very little trouble with the bit walking and drilling
continued to the casing point at 172 m. The hole was
circulated with 100 bbls of hivis mud before displacing
the hole with 300 bbis ( 2 x hole volume ) of prehydrated

LITHOLOGY : bioclastic calcarenite sandstone

DRILLING SUMMARY :

After pressure tesing the surface equipment NB3 was
picked up and nun into the hole . Cement was tagged at
166 m and the cement shoe track shoe and rathole was
drilled out . New 17.5 hole was drilled from 172 m to
272 m with seawater gel mud losing returns totally at
200 m. Partial returns were present from 251 m to 272
m at which depth the bit was pulled back to 108 m to
repair the IBOP valve on the TDS . Full returns were lost
once the bit was run back to bottom and began drilling .
Drilling continued with seawater and two 50bbl hivis
sweeps being pumped with every stand drilled .

Drilling continued from 272 m to 884 m with seawater
and hivis sweeps . At 884 m a sudden increase in ROP
indicated that the bit had entered the Grebe Sandstone
Formation . Drilling continued with little or no weight
on the bit and a 50 bbl hivis sweep on every joint . New
hole was drilled to 923 m at which point the pipe
became stuck . The pipe was worked and jarred back to
915 m with the hole being circulated with seawater hi
vis pills and LCM .

At this point the keily hose burst and had to be replaced .

After doing this the hole was circulated with 200 bbls of
1445 sg mud before returning to circulating with 1.04 sg
mud . A 45 bbl pili of Pipe Lax was then pumped and
chased with 32 bbls of mud without effect .

DRILLING AND ENGINEERING

It was then decided to backoff the drillstring . A
freepoint tool was subsequently run and located the
freepoint just below the jars . Charges were run to 871.3
m but the tool misfired . A second attempt was
successful and on retrieving the drillstring it was found
that 42.83 m of fish was left in the hole the top of which
was located at 872m above the 9.5 to 8.25 collar
CTOSS Over .

The 17.5 hole section was then plugged back to 776 m
prior to running 13.375 casing and kicking off the
12.25 hole .

LITHOLOGY : Bioclastic calcarenite
DRILLING SUMMARY :

This was a kickoff assembly designed to sidetrack the
well . The AKO sub was set at 1.4 and the entire
drillstring was scribed into the hole . Oriented time
drilling began at 776 m with negligable weight on bit
and 25 m were cut in 10.5 hrs in this way . Cuttings
samples and MWD surveys gave indeterminate
indications as to whether the kickoff had been
successful . From 801 m the weight on bit was increased
to 2 15 kib with an associated increase in penetration
rate . Samples and MWD surveys showed the kickoff
had been successful between 805 815 m. From 849 m
surface rotation was used with 55 RPM to stop building
but maintain the angle . Drilling continued to 877 m
where the bit was pulled without problems to change to
a pendulum assembly . This point was just above the
Grebe Sandstone at 884 m and just below the top of the
fish at 872 m. On pulling out a washout was found on
the second tooljoint below the jars ( the box was
cracked and the pin washed ) and both drillcollars were
laid out .

DRILLING SUMMARY :

The bit was run in to the shoe at 766.9 m and washed
and reamed down to 877 m. As soon as drilling began
mud losses were seen ranging from 200 bblshr at 880
m up to a maximum of 450 bblshr at 928 m .
Accordingly a 150 bbl LCM pill was fully circulated
prior to the connection at 928 m. This reduced the mud
losses to less than 180 bblhr . With further drilling and
the addition of fresh premixed prehydrated gel the mud
losses were reduced to below 25 bblhr by 1060 m .
Controlled drilling continued to 1055 m with partial
mud losses from 1217 m 1246 m and 1299 1303 m .
There was a short lived loss of returns at 1265 m but
the mud soon came back without the need for any
remedial action . Trouble free drilling continued to 1374
m and the bit was pulled to surface without problems .
One suite of wireline logs then run GPITSDTDLL
CALGRAMS to a total depth of 1375.5 m. The 9 58
casing was then run ..

DRILLING SUMMARY :

This bit was used to drill out the 9 58 casing shoe and
drilled ahead while looking for a core point with the aid
of MWD . At 1572 m there was a drill break from 9 mhr
to 48 mhr and the well was flow checked static at
1573 m. Controlled drilling continued to 1578 m where
bottomsup were circulated . There were insufficient
shows to merit cutting a core and drilling continued to a
total depth of 1646 m without incident .

The bit was pulled without problems and the four
subsequent wireline logging runs reached TD also
without problems . The wireline TD was 1648.5 m .

After running the logs a muleshoe was made up and run
in on 2 78 tubing and 5 drillpipe to begin the
plugging of the well see the Casing and Cementing
Section .

REMARKS

The casing was run without returns and without drag . On
reaching bottom it was circulated again without returns . The
single stage cement job took place without returns although
10 bbls of mud did reach the surface while displacing the
cement with the rig pumps . :

The subsequent leakoff test made after drilling to 1379 m
required 2660 psi surface pressure with a mud weight of 1.15
sg to fracture the formation . This gave an exceptionally high
equivalent mud weight of 2.51 sg .

71 . MWD OPERATIONS SUMMARY

Baker Hughes Inteqs Dual Propogation Resistivity ( DPR ) and Directional MWD services were utilised onboard the ATWOOD EAGLE for the drilling of BHPs Calytrix1 STI well in the
ACIP2 Permit about 650 km from Darwin . BHIs MWD services were used from kickoff in the 12.25 section and in the 8.5 hole sections to TD at 1646 m RT . BHIs MWD services were
completed on May 1st 1995 . All depths were measured in meires below rotary table located 22.0 m above MISLW and were based on the drillers pipe tally .

74 MWD Tool Operational Summary

MWD Run # 1 ( Bit Run # 6 ) DHB 845010

The tool was picked up with a Mach 1C Navidrill PDM and flow tested at surface before rumning in the hole .
The string was run in with the highside mark followed up the string . After tagging bottom the toolface was
oriented due north and the kickoff commenced . Sliding continued to 848 m before drilling ahead in rotary mode
to 877 m. Surveys were initially taken at each tool joint and then when necessary . No surface decoding
difficulties were encountered . Drilling and mud parameters were within tool tolerances throughout the run .

MWD Run # 2 ( Bit Run # 9 ) DHE 164315

The tool was picked up in a packed assembly and surface tested . A shallow test was performed after the first
stand of drill collars . Cement was drilled out along with the shoe and 5 m of new formation before a LOT was
performed . Drilling continued with surveys at every third stand . The Gibson Woolaston and Nome Formations
were picked on MWD data . Poor shows in the Nome Sands led to drilling through to TD without coring . No
surface decoding difficulties were encountered . Drilling and mud parameters were within tool tolerances
throughout the run . The tool memory was downloaded at surface and a good recorded log was produced . The
tool clamshells showed normal wear .

PRESSURE EVALUATION

91 PORE PRESSURE EVALUATION

When returns were available at surface there was little or no gas recorded throughout the well . Hole conditions
did not indicate overpressure and neither did dxc or mud temperature trends . There were no pressure cavings
seen and there were no unexplained pit level rises . From spud to 1374 m the mud weight in was 1.04 sg and
from 1374 to 1646 m the mud weight was 1.15 sg . Thus in the latter section overpressure may have occurred
but been masked by the higher mudweight . However in the absence of any evidence to the contrary ( no RFTs
were run on this well ) it was concluded that pore pressures were normal and a normal saline pore pressure
gradient of 1.04 sg was assumed for pressure calculations in Calytrix1 and its sidetrack .

9.2 FRACTURE PRESSURE EVALUATION

There were total mud losses while drilling the original hole from 200 923 m with only partial losses from 251
272 m. The lithologies over this section are known to be limestone and sandstone in which mud losses are
common . Given the low calculated fracture gradients above 350 m see the Formation Pressure Summary
Table in section 9.3 it is likely that losses were due to hydraulic fracturing particularly when considering the
associated high ROPs and resulting annular loading . At the same time losses may have been due to vuggy
porosity in the limestone section and high permeability in the Grebe Sandstone .

At 884 m the Grebe Sandstone was penetrated marked by a distinct drillbreak . Drilling continued with very
high ROPs and no returns and at 923 m the pipe became stuck . With total losses at that depth it was
impossible to calculate the true annular gradient but even with full returns there . would have been 60 m of cut
formation in the annulus adding another 0.12 sg to the ECD . With such high annular loading while drilling a
sandstone losses are likely to have both through fracture and seepage with resulting differential sticking . With
the pumps off packing off was also likely and certainly occurred after the kelly hose burst while working the
pipe .

In the following sidetrack rates of penetration were rigidly controlled to no more than one stand per hour and
with a few minor exceptions full returns were maintained to TD . There were partial losses in the Grebe
Sandstone but these were cured with LCM and continued circulation .

The leakoff test performed after drilling out the 9 58 casing shoe at 1374 m failed to fracture the formation
with an EQMW of 2.51 sg . This was very high and exceeded the estimated overburden pressure inferring that
the interval densities derived from the sonic logs of the first suite of elogs were too low and that the mari in
which the shoe was set had an unusually high Poissons ratio .

Im conclusion the mud losses in the Calytrix well occurred as a result of hydraulic fracturing and high
permeability . In this way annular loading caused by uncontrolled rates of penetration caused the pipe to
become stuck in the original hole . This was demonstated by the fact that the same section drilled in the
sidetrack with controlled drilling suffered no such problems .

Fracture pressure estimation was done using the Baker Hughes INTEQ zero tensile strength method . The
overburden gradient was calculated from offset well data and wireline density data when it was available from

the 8.5 phase .

3 . Sonic Calibration Processing
3.1 Sonic Calibration

A drift curve is obtained using the sonic log and the vertical check level times . The
term drift is defined as the seismic time ( from check shots ) minus the sonic time
( from integration of edited sonic ) . Commonly the word drift is used to identify the
above difference or to identify the gradient of drift versus increasing depth or to
identify a difference of drift between two levels .

The gradient of drift that is the slope of the drift curve can be negative or positive .

Adr if t
Adepth so
For a negative drift the sonic time is greater than the seismic time
over a certain section of the log .

For a positive drift 4grift 5 O the sonic time is less than the seismic time over a
Adepth
certain section of the log .

The drift curve between two levels is then an indication of the error on the
integrated sonic or an indication of the amount of correction required on the sonic to
have the TTI of the corrected sonic match the check shot times .

Two methods of correction to the sonic log are used .

1 . Uniform or block shift . This method applies a uniform correction to all the
sonic values over the interval . This uniform correction is applied in the case of
positive drift and is the average correction represented by the drift curve gradient
expressed in psecft .

2 . AT Minimum . In the case of negative drift a second method is used called
AT minimum . This applies a differential correction to the sonic log where it is
assumed that the greatest amount of transit time error is caused by the lower velocity
sections of the log . Over a given interval the method will correct only At values which
are higher than a threshold the Atmin Values of At which are lower than the
threshold are not corrected . The correction is a reduction of the excess of At over

Atmin At A tmin

AtA tmin is reduced through multiplication by a reduction coefficient which remains
constant over the interval . This reduction coefficient named G can be defined as :

( Ci ian
HAtA tmin ) dZ

Where drift is the drift over the interval to be corrected and the value JA tA tmin ) dZ
is the time difference between the integrals of the two curves A t and A tmin only over
the intervals where A t5 A tmin

Hence the corrected sonic : At G ( A t A tmin ) t 4 tmin

3.2 Open Hole Logs

The sonic log has been recorded from 1645.0 to 767.0 metres below DF . This sonic
tog has been edited to alleviate cycle skipping and spiky data . The density log has
also been edited to take into account bad hole condition .

The gamma ray and caliper logs are included as correlation curves .

3.3 Correction to Datum and Veiocity Modelling
The sonic calibration processing has been referenced to mean sea level which the

seismic reference datum . Static corrections are applied to correct for source offset
and source depth . This involves using a water velocity of 1524 msec .

3.4 Sonic Calibration Results

The top of the sonic log ( 767.0 metres below DF ) is chosen as the origin for the
calibration drift curve .

The drift curve is the correction imposed upon the sonic log . The adjusted sonic
curve is considered to be the best result using the available data . A list of shifts used
on the sonic data is given below .

4 . Synthetic Seismogram Processing

GEOGRAM plots were generated using 25 35 and 45 Hz zero phase ricker
wavelets .

The presentations include both normal and reverse polarity on a time scale of 10
cmvsec .

GEOGRAM processing produces synthetic seismic traces based on reflection
coefficients generated form sonic and density measurements in the wellbore . The
steps in the processing chain are the following :

Depth to time conversion
Reflection coefficient generation
Attenuation coefficient calculation
Convolution

Output

4.1 Depth to Time Conversion
Open hole logs are recorded from the bottom to top with a depth index . This data is

converted to a twoway time index and flipped to read form the top to bottom in order
to match the seismic section .

4.2 Primary Reflection Coefficients

Sonic and density data are averaged over chosen time intervals ( normally 2 or 4
millisecs ) . Reflection coefficients are then computed using :

PaVa p1.N1
pa Va t pi.V1
where :

p1 z density of the layer above the reflection interface

pa density of the layer below the reflection interface
v4 sz compressional wave velocity of the layer above the reflection interface
Vo compressional wave velocity of the layer below the reflection interface

This computation is done for each time interval to generate a set of primary reflection
coefficients without transmission losses .

-----Page 162-----

4.3 Primaries with Transmission Loss

Transmission loss on twoway attenuation coefficients is computed using :

An 3 ( 1 R92 ) . ( 1 Ro2 ) . ( 1 R32 ) ... ( 1 Rn ? )
A set of primary reflection coefficients with transmission loss is generated using :

Primaryn z RnAn1

4.4 Primaries plus Multiples

Multiples are computed from these input reflection coefficients using the transform
technique from the top of the well to obtain the impulse response of the earth . The
transform outputs primaries plus multiples .

4.5 Multiples Only

By subtracting previously calculated primaries form the above result we obtain
multiples only .

4.6 Wavelet

A theoretical wavelet is chosen to use for convolution with the reflection coefficients
previoulsy generated . Choices available include :

Klauder wavelet

Ricker zero phase wavelet
Ricker minimum phase wavelet
Butterworth wavelet

User defined wavelet

Time variant Butterworth filtering can be applied after convolution .

4.7 Polarity Convention

An increase in acoustic impedance gives a positive reflection coefficient is written to
tape as a negative number and is displayed as a white trough under normal polarity .
Polarity conventions are displayed in figure 1 .

5

-----Page 163-----

4.8 Convolution

The standard procedure of convolving the wavelet with reflection coefficients the
output is the synthetic seismogram .

5 . VSP Processing

The vertical component of the VSP data was processed using the conventional zero
offset vertical incident processing chain . The following subsections describe the
main aspects of the processing chain .

5.1 Stacking

A median stack was performed on the vertica ! and horizontal component data .

The surface sensor ( hydrophone ) breaks are used as the zero timefor stacking . The
break time of each trace is recomputed after stacking .

The data quality is fairly good with the vertical component stacks displaying a
consistent signature and a high signal to noise ratio as seen on Plot 1 .

5.2 Spherical Divergence Correction and Bandpass Filter

A bandpass filter of 5100 hertz bandwidth was applied and time varying gain
function of the exponential form :

T o
GAIN ( T ) z ( )
To

where T is the recorded time To is the first break time and a 1.0

Trace equalisation was applied by normalising the RMS amplitude of the first break
to correct for transmission losses of the direct wave . A normalisation window of 100
millisecs was used ( see plot 1 ) .

-----Page 164-----

5.3 Velocity filter

The downgoing coherent energy is estimated using a three levels median velocity
filter . The filter array is moved down one level after each computation and the
process is repeated level by level over the entire data set . As a result the deepest
and shallowest levels are lost because of edge effects .

The residual wavefield is obtained by subtracting the downgoing coherent energy
from the total wavefield . The residual wavefield is dominated by reflected
compressional events ( plot 3 ) .

The upgoing wavefield is enhanced by making a median stack of the upgoing
aligned traces using a 5 levels filter . The data is now displayed in two way time ( plot
2 ) .

5.4 Waveshaping Deconvolution

The waveshaping deconvolution operator is a double sided operator and is
designed trace by trace opening 20 ms before the first break with a window length of
1000 ms . The desired outputs were chosen to be zero phase with a band width of
0580 Hz . Once the design is made upon the downgoing wavefield it is applied to
the downgoing and subtracted wavefield at the same level . The upgoing
compressional wavefield is enhanced in an exactly analogous manner to before .

The trace by trace deconvolution is applied in order to collapse the multiple
sequence of shear arrivals diffractions or out of plane reflections . The result of
waveshaping deconvolution on the upgoing wavefield is shown in Plot 3 .

A corridor stack was computed on the data after zero phase waveshaping
deconvolution by defining a timing window 150 msec wide along the time depth
curve and stacking the data onto a single trace . This trace under normal
circumstances should satisfy the assumption of one dimensionality and provide the
best seismic representation of the borehole . This is displayed on Plot 4 .

-----Page 165-----

5.5 VSP Acoustic Impedance Inversion

The zero phase waveshaping should permit a better interpretation of acoustic
contrast hence the data used for the inversion has been taken from the VSP after
zero phase waveshaping deconvolution .

The inversion technique is based on entropy minimisation of the reflection coefficient
series . In other words the algorithm chooses the sparsest sequences of reflection
coefficients as the preferred solution . The low frequency trend is extracted from the
time depth curve such that the inversion technique is achieved without any input
from the logged data .

It is important to point out that the acoustic impedance inversion is obtained without
any input from the logged data . The quality of the inversion can be assessed by the
similarity of the match between the logged impedance and inverted impedance .

Plots 5 and 6 are composite displays of the VSP data inverted impedance logged
impedance and synthetic seismograms . These displays are a guide to the tie
between the geograms and corridor stack .

There is a fairly good tie between the synthetic seismogram and VSP . There are
some subtle variations on the Amplitude of the events . The VSP provides a measure
of the earth filter effect whilst the synthetic makes some very basic assumptions to
approximate the earth filter effect .

13th of April when the last anchor # 7 was racked . The Atwood Eagle began the move to Calytrix1
under tow of the MV Pacific Conqueror . Anchor recovery operations were protracted due to mechanical
problems with # 6 winch .

At 0950 on the 14th of April 1995 # 7 anchor was dropped from the rig on the runin to the proposed
location . The rig continued under tow paying out # 7 anchor chain until it was approximately over
location at 1015 . Anchor deployment continued until 1940 on the 14th of April 1995 when the last anchor
pennant # 2 was passed back to the rig . At 1945 on the 14th of April the rig began moving towards the
intended location at 2025 the rig was within the specified tolerance for the well . Anchor cross tensioning
was completed by 2035 on the 14th of April 1995 . The rig began ballasting down at 1840 on the 14th of
April 1995 and reached drilling draft at 0115 on the 15th of April 1995 .

At 1900 on the 14th of April a gyro calibration was performed using the Golf II Laser sighting onto the co
ordinated pile of the Challis Venture giving a CO of 0.2 ? from 5 rounds of observed angles .

A final DGPS fix was observed between the hours of 0342 and 0425 on the 15th of April 1995 .

At 0440 on the 15th of April 1995 demobilisation of positioning equipment commenced and was completed
by 0600 that morning .

Personnel departed the rig by helicopter at 0830 on the 15th of April 1995 arriving in Darwin at 1240 .

3 . FINAL DRILLSTEM POSITION

The final differential GPS position of the drillstem over Calytrix1 location was determined using Racals
SkyFix Trimble 4000 MultiFix DGPS .

Observations were obtained between 0342 and 0425 on the 15th of April 1995 . The final fix analysis
function in the GNS Rigmove software was used to obtain the DGPS observations and compute the position
of the drillstem .

Differential corrections from the SkyFix reference stations in Darwin Broome Ujung Pandang Dampier
and Troughton Island were used to derive the DGPS position . A check position was observed using
differential corrections from the DeltaFix LR reference station on Troughton Island .

The final coordinates for the Calytrix1 well determined from DGPS observations were as follows :

Constellation Samples Satellites
A 8 06 05 09 24 20 26 12
B 65 06 05 09 24 20 12
Cc 23 06 05 09 24 20 12 17
D 3 06 05 09 24 20 17
E 25 06 05 09 24 20 12 16
F 62 06 05 09 24 20 16 17

Total number of samples used 186

The computed antenna position with constellations given equal weights was as follows :

Antenna Position

Datum WGS 84

Latitude : 12 ? 09 17.515 South ( s.d . 0.29m )
Longitude : 124 . 54 58.347 East ( s.d . 0.17m )
Spheroidal Height : 56.70m ( s.d . 0.54m )

Transforming the above WGS 84 coordinates to AGD 84 using the parameters in section 2 gives the
following antenna coordinates :

5 . DISCUSSION

5.1 EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE

DGPS

The DGPS rig installation consisted of a Trimble 4000 DLII 9 channel receiver interfaced to a Compaq
desktop 48666 computer operating Racals MultiFix 2 multiple reference station software . The MultiFix 2
software was used on the drilling rig to provide differentially corrected position to the General Navigation
System ( GNS ) utilising raw data from the Trimble GPS receiver and RTCM 104 messages from a
combination of upto five SkyFix reference stations and one DeltaFix LR reference station .

The SkyFix Differential GPS reference stations consist of two Trimble DS 12 channel receivers interfaced
to Compaq desktop 386 computers operating Trimble DeltaNav reference software . The reference stations
are controlled via modem by the Singapore SkyFix control centre .

The DeltaFix LR differential GPS reference station consists of a Trimble 4000 RL II GPS Receiver
interfaced to a Compaq 48666 computer operating Trimble DeltaNav reference software . The RTCM 104
corrections are transmitted over two HF frequencies from the reference station .

The DGPS positioning performance of the rig was reliable throughout the project .

Positioning of the AHVs during Anchor Handling Operations was achieved using a Golf II Laser
interfaced to the General Navigation System ( GNS ) rigmove software .

Navigation System

The drilling rig Atwood Eagle installation consisted of a Compaq portable 48666 computer operating
Racals General Navigation System ( GNS ) rigmove software version R305 . Associated peripheral
equipment included printer and a Compaq 486 laptop computer operating Racals GRREP graphics repeater
software .

The navigation system operated without fault throughout all phases of the rig move operation .

52 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

All positioning equipment performed well throughout the rig move with the exception of a faulty laser
battery which has been returned to Perth for repair .
