One way to gain a sound knowledge about the geology and the\r\nexploration history is to analyse the vast amount of data accumulated over the years in an unstructured\r\nmanner. A sustainable data driven strategy leveraging on the latest advancement of Machine Learning\r\n(ML) and Analytics is applied on vast amount of unstructured data. By highlighting the data driven\r\nstrategy, the paper demonstrates such a strategy applied to pre-salt carbonates prospects located in the\r\nCampos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil. The interpretation framework consists of first step, to\r\nidentify the regional first order trends and second step, to recognize the second order anomalies over\r\nthe full area providing a holistic picture of the area of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe unstructured data comprise of more than 48,000 documents, primarily in Portuguese language, for\r\na total of 330,000 pages related to 50 years of exploration, covering the Campos and Santos Basins. The\r\nmethodologies are divided into two parts. In the part one methodology, the unstructured data is\r\nprocessed using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for name\r\nentity recognition and language translation, and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for auto-\r\nimage recognition (Hernandez et al., 2019). In part two methodology, ML Analytics leverages the\r\nvisualization for data relationships to give a holistic view of the whole corpus (Baillard et al., 2021).\r\nThree steps study is used here, as explained below with illustration at Figure 1.\r\n Step 1: Deep Search through text is the ability to use keywords search within the whole corpus\r\nand filter the wanted results. Filtered information is easily accessible for investigation. Deep\r\nSearch is also applied for images. DCNN image recognition and classification techniques classify\r\nthe images into eight categories: thin section, core, well plot, seismic, stratigraphic structural\r\nelements, map, table, and figure. A deep search allows user to search information tagged and\r\nidentified in these images. This step is to identify the geological and exploration challenges\r\nrelated to the area of interest.\r\nStep 2: Heat Map highlights the hot zones on map based on the frequency of the keywords\r\nfound. Drawing a polygon on the map allows user to confine the search to focus only in the zone\r\nof their interest. On the other hand, instant text search through the whole corpus of English and\r\nPortuguese documents is possible with the automated translation. Users able to search through\r\nPortuguese documents using English keywords.\r\nStep 3: Contextual Knowledge Graph illustrates the connectivity of related corpuses based on\r\nwell name referencing. This is useful to obtain related information from different wells\r\n(Hernandez et al., 2019). Besides that, Intuition provides clustered images view, a great approach\r\nto discover analogues for alike images such as thin section, core, SEM, and biomarker.\r\n\r\nFigure I The data driven search strategy implementing the ML Analytics for visualization of data\r\nrelationships for a holistic view of whole corpus for a Sustainable Future\r\n\r\n\r\nCase study: Understanding the Pre-Salt Carbonate Regional Trends and Anomalies in Campos and Santos Basins:\r\nThe Campos and Santos Basins, located to the east offshore of Brazil, are some of the most prolific oil\r\nand gas basins in the world with significant discoveries such as Tupi, Jupiter and Libra Fields. The\r\ninvestigation of the 50 years of pre-salt exploration history contained in the 48,000 documents processed\r\nrevealed that most of the challenges during exploration are caused by 1. Fluid distribution 2. The\r\nreservoir quality 3. CO2 and H2S presence 4. Overpressure patterns,\r\n\r\n1. Campos and Santos Basins are showing a variable fluid distribution. The type and quality of\r\nthe fluid trends are keys to define the best target for a sustainable development.\r\n\r\n2. The diagenesis affects the reservoir quality. A good visualization of the lateral distribution of\r\nsuch process allows a better estimation of the porosity and the volume in place.\r\nThe regional gas issues, such as understanding the presence of CO2 and H2S is essential to\r\ngauge the reservoir diagenesis properties as well as to plan for production facilities or to avoid\r\nregions of sour and hazardous gaseous.\r\nThe irregularity in the thickness of the salt layer causes variability in the pressure regime with\r\noverpressure over the zone of interest and affecting the drilling campaigns.\r\n\r\nThese challenges are relevant to understand the geology and production issues encountered in distinct\r\nparts of the basins to improve sustainable in the exploration risk and reducing CO? footprint.\r\n\r\nFor the pre-salt oil trendings, Campos pre-salt generally has lighter oil compared to Santos pre-salt. As\r\nfor the anomalies, light oil or condensate discovery at Pau De Acucar, Seat and Gavea Fields in Campos\r\npre-salt, while heavy mostly found in the post-salt in the Southern Campos. In Santos, heavy oil reported\r\nin Jupiter Field. Note that heavy oil also discovered in Atlanta and Oliva Fields at post-salt. Illustration\r\nin Figure 2.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 Heat map highlights the wells with heavy oil information. The oil API delineation is based\r\non Deep Search extraction from test reports for Santos (left map) and Campos (right map). Knowledge\r\nGraph was analyzed to find a group of fields that share the light oil information  Gavea, Seat and Pao\r\nde Acucar Fields.\r\n\r\nNext, we study the facies distribution at pre-salt carbonate. A collection of core and thin section images\r\nare retrieved from the Deep Search through images. In general, it is observed that the reservoir\r\nformation is in the shrub facies, microbiolites and coquina. For the trendingss, the area with COQo,\r\nleaching activities enhance the porosity, example in the Libra, Buzios Fields, going south to Tupi and\r\nCarcara Fields in Santos. Fields proximal to the shore has poorer reservoir quality. One of the anomalies\r\nobserved is the hydrothermal activity can destroy the enhanced porosity by the leaching. The\r\nhydrothermal activity is anticipated in Field Albacora, Carcara, based on the observation on the core.\r\nIllustration in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nFigure 3 Pre-salt carbonate facies distribution based on core and thin sections collection from Deep\r\nSearch through images. Analysing the diagenesis trend has an impact on reservoir quality\r\ninterpretation. (core and thin section images are taken from BDEP-ANP reports and Core Lab study)\r\n\r\nThe following study is to investigate the regional gas issues. The trend is showing that Santos is\r\nsuffering higher CO2 contamination compared to Campos, especially in the center deep-water Santos\r\narea. Jupiter Field suffers from very high concentration of CO2 gas, 79% recorded. Center deeper-water\r\nSantos is suffering from CO2 contamination potentially near to the mantel magmatic activities\r\nintercepted by deep-seated fault (Luca et al., 2017). Hazardous H2S gas presence in high amount\r\n(exceeding OSHA safe limit 50 ppm) in the Buzios, Iara Fields of Santos and Xerelete, Albacora Fields\r\nof Campos. Illustration in Figure 4.\r\n\r\nLastly, is the study of formation pressure pattern. The formation data points are quickly extracted from\r\nunstructured data over 80 wells using Deep Search. The points are then plotted on gradient psi/ft ranging\r\nfrom 0.35 to 0.7 psi/ft. Based on the pressure gradient validation, wells in Carcara, Sagitario and\r\nCorcovado Fields have exceptionally high formation pressure. An interpretation of fullstack PSDM\r\ncross-section shows thick salt area in Carcara and Sagitario, possible with faulting causes saline water\r\nintrusion which contribute to high pressure zone. Irregularity in thickness of salt layer causes variability\r\nin pressure regime, such as overpressure area to take note as this will have an impact on seismic\r\ninterpretation and drilling campaign.

Exceptionally high pressure recorded in Guaratiba Group in Carcara, Sagitario and\r\nCorcovado, possible due to high salt thickness and faulting causes saline water. Fullstack PSDM cross\r\nsection shows thick salt in area of Carcara and Sagitario (courtesy of Kattah et al., 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe research shows the effectiveness of using ML/AI technologies and Analytics to mine through the\r\nvast amount of unstructured data and gain insights related to the regional trends and anomalies of\r\nimportant geological, reservoir and production parameters to minimize the risk of exploration and\r\nreduce carbon footprint.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75ec2758-abea-4784-9b73-192982614815": {"__data__": {"id_": "75ec2758-abea-4784-9b73-192982614815", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_name": "2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10919, "creation_date": "2024-07-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d691e30-ed09-4e9f-a6d8-df306df1a600", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_name": "2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10919, "creation_date": "2024-07-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-08"}, "hash": "1912fb5ee47b41c9227dd0c11a8a081708e6376dcc00ea546abea0c66e9e4c91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e794f791-fcdb-4880-be9f-f8f6ec3ef489", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_name": "2022 - Utilizing Machine Learning to Gain Geological Insights through Unstructured Data for  Sustainable Exploration Activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10919, "creation_date": "2024-07-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-08"}, "hash": "7461489dd422a40d251fb9a15d5423b819beb9d814f1bf02b0c63453411b148f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hazardous H2S gas presence in high amount\r\n(exceeding OSHA safe limit 50 ppm) in the Buzios, Iara Fields of Santos and Xerelete, Albacora Fields\r\nof Campos.
