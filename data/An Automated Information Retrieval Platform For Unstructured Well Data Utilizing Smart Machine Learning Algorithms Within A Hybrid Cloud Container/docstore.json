These technical documents contain\r\nvaluable information from diverse disciplines such as geology, geophysics, petrophysics, reservoir\r\nengineering, drilling and other subject matters and are in general stored in a unstructured format.\r\n\r\nEspecially national data management systems and oil companies hosts these large amounts of very\r\nvaluable historical well data, which contain information such as reservoir metadata, images, texts, and\r\nprocessed information, such as lithology, geology, shows, drilling risks etc. Due to the large volume,\r\nvintage variety, and non-standard formats, extraction of valuable information, which can be used as\r\ninput for further work, is an arduous task as the manual nature of data mining is very time-consuming.\r\n\r\nTo extract and utilize all this well data, a machine learning-enabled platform has been developed as a\r\nhybrid cloud container that automatically reads and understands hundreds or thousands of technical\r\ndocuments with little human supervision. The aim of the platform is to ease the identification of\r\nimportant parts of the technical documents, automatically extract relevant information and visualize it\r\nfor the user, so they can easily do further analysis, share it with colleagues or agnostically port it to\r\nother platforms as input.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe platform utilizes a hybrid data service architecture, which leverages the 2-tier strength of both\r\ncloud and private servers. The hybrid architecture serves to:\r\n\r\nEnhance the platform\ufffds security and data privacy by storing raw data locally\r\nIncrease data shareability in real-time by utilizing a cloud solution\r\n\r\nReduce data redundancy and increase data integrity among users\r\n\r\nProvide a pragmatic solution to optimize data storage costs\r\n\r\nThe user can upload raw data to the platform, which are stored on a private local server. The machine\r\nlearning algorithms are activated and implement the necessary processing and workflows. Structured\r\ndata is generated as output, which are pushed through to a search engine that is accessible to the user\r\nin the cloud (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nFigure 1 The hybrid architecture of platform (ElasticDocs) utilizing the 2-tier strength of local and\r\ncloud sever applications for data security, integrity and shareability.

This conversion uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR),\r\nwhere the machine identifies each character in the image.\r\n\r\nAfter the documents are digitized important information has to be identified. This metadata extraction\r\nand tagging utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tokenize each digitized text and identify\r\nterms of significant value. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is then performed to create a model to\r\nextract the metadata like well name, basin, permit, operator, well classification, latitude, longitude,\r\nspudding date, kelly bushing etc.\r\n\r\nFor the images extracted by the digitization process, a modified VGG-16 neural network is used to\r\nautomatically classify tables, charts, stratigraphic chart images, maps, seismic, core samples and\r\nscanning electron microscope images within each document (Simonyan ef al., 2014)\r\n\r\nFor the visualization of the images an at-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\r\nalgorithm is used to quantify the similarity of each image, which has been developed to visualize\r\nhigh-dimensional datasets and reveal clustering within the datasets (van der Maaten e\ufffd al., 2008).\r\n\r\nThe output from the machine learning sequence is then exposed to the users through the platform to\r\nease the work of identifying important information and perform analysis in a more efficient way. The\r\nextracted information is outputted in an agnostic format, which can be efficiently loaded to other\r\nplatforms or used as is, ie. X, Y or Latitude/Longitude, formation tops in csv or excel format,\r\ndigitized maps as shapefile for loading into GIS software.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion and conclusion:\r\nWells provide key information about the subsurface in oil and gas exploration and production but at a\r\nsubstantial cost. As this valuable information associated with a well is often stored as unstructured\r\ndata, it is difficult to do further analysis or apply additional artificial intelligence processing to the\r\nwell database to enable geoscientists to gain new insights and extract new relationships.\r\n\r\nThe carefully selected sequence of machine learning algorithms in the workflow deals with these\r\nlarge unstructured datasets, is housed within a hybrid cloud platform to automatically extract relevant\r\ninformation within technical documents and convert the unstructured data into a shareable structured\r\ndataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nSimonyan, K. & Zisserman, A., 2014: Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image\r\nRecognition. arXiv preprint arXiv: 1409.1556\r\n\r\nvan der Maaten, L.J.P. & Hinton G.E., 2008]: Visualizing High-Dimensional Data using t-SNE.\r\nJournal of Machine Learning Research, 9, 2576-2605.\r\non Machine Learning", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4079, "end_char_idx": 7667, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"3ddebed4-9a13-4c3c-83d5-a9ed09b0bc4b": {"doc_hash": "840e0bea4d3d87ac3a6cb37881eea840d0a325be6286125a1a3263b64a56ae22", "ref_doc_id": "99fb3553-71b0-4c90-ae8a-0d71d55f6d4a"}, "183b8a9b-ba8d-495a-83dd-633e802d9045": {"doc_hash": "89e35633e507f8fe66377c4c34d782c1641d1c4cea2315c4a1db9df11f0f1dc2", "ref_doc_id": "99fb3553-71b0-4c90-ae8a-0d71d55f6d4a"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"99fb3553-71b0-4c90-ae8a-0d71d55f6d4a": {"node_ids": ["3ddebed4-9a13-4c3c-83d5-a9ed09b0bc4b", "183b8a9b-ba8d-495a-83dd-633e802d9045"], "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\2021 - An Automated Information Retrieval Platform For Unstructured Well Data Utilizing Smart Machine Learning Algorithms Within A Hybrid Cloud Container.txt", "file_name": "2021 - An Automated Information Retrieval Platform For Unstructured Well Data Utilizing Smart Machine Learning Algorithms Within A Hybrid Cloud Container.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7679, "creation_date": "2024-07-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-05"}}}}
