As a result, geoscientists and engineers spend 50 to 80% of\r\ntheir time searching and assembling data and only 1 to 5% of the data is fully utilized. The value of\r\ntechnical work is therefore reduced due to the lack of time available for analysis and critical thinking\r\nand the under-utilization of the data. To assist geoscientist and engineers, Machine Learning (ML)\r\nand Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are applied to process the unstructured data making it\r\npossible to perform more accurate analysis and make faster decisions.\r\n\r\nIn this case study the area of interest covers Bonaparte Basin, which is located north-west of\r\nthe Australian continental margin (Figure 1). It joins the Money Shoal basin in the north-east and\r\nthe Browse Basin in the south-west. Furthermore, the Timor Trough defines the northern boundary.\r\nThe areal extent of the basin is approximately 270,000 sq. km. The objective of this study is to\r\nunderstand and obtain meaningful insights into the Bonaparte Basin based on the substantial amount\r\nof information available in previous studies, reports and presentations. The unstructured data of the\r\nBonaparte Basin have been ingested in a Knowledge Container through consecutive ML and AI\r\npipelines and analysed using big data analytics tools.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 Location of the Bonaparte Basin within the Australian continental margin (left) and 14\r\nstructural elements observed within the Bonaparte Basin (right).\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nAs of 2021, the Bonaparte Basin encompasses 440 wells representing 58 years of exploration history\r\nsummarized in over 270,000 pages of documents and in 250,000 images. It is estimated that billions of\r\ndollars have been invested over the years to acquire and interprete the data, making it a substantial\r\nsource of information for new exploration activities.\r\n\r\nThe Play Based Exploration (PBE) approach is often used as a traditional framework to refine the\r\ngeoscientists s understanding from a broad basin level to a narrow prospect focus (Lottaroli et al., 2016).\r\nAs a start such an approach often involves capturing the current state of knowledge with massive\r\nbackground resources to understand and analyse the key features of the basin and the major risks\r\nassociated to it. Such information is primarily available in unstructured data, requiring geoscientist and\r\nengineers to process and ingest the information before focusing on a specific play and prospect using\r\nstructured data. Therefore, we have modified the existing PBE pyramid to introduce an additional\r\n\r\ndimension associated with data science identifying the different types of data available at different\r\nstages, allowing us to better define the best suited ML/AI strategy for a given stage (Figure 2).\r\n\r\nFigure 2 Customized Play Based Exploration (PBE) pyramid with ML technology (Modified from\r\nLottaroli et al., 2016).\r\n\r\nFocusing on the unstructured data associated with the Basin and Play Analysis, all the data from the\r\nBonaparte Basin have been processed through a succession of AI/ML automated pipeline such as\r\nNatural Language Processing or Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Hernandez et al., 2019), (Figure\r\n3). The sharable structured data is then further processed through deeper level of analytics to detect\r\ntrends and anomalies present within the data. Machine assistance is heavily used in repetitive tasks early\r\nin the process during the processing of the data and up to 95% of the tasks will be performed by the\r\nmachine. This provides additional time for the specialist to focus on critical thinking and cognitive skills\r\n\r\nFigure 3 Unstructured Big Data pipeline\r\n\r\nIn this case study, interpretation using the Big Data workflow was used to understand the exploration\r\nhistory, how the basin developed, its petroleum system and the main issue of the dry wells occurrence\r\nto avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and improve future decision making.\r\n\r\nBy analysing the data, five potential issues are identified i.e. (i) Discrepancies in Formation Tops, (ii)\r\nLimited understanding of Lithology Distribution, (iii) Limited Mineral Composition Understanding,\r\n(iv) Fluid Distribution, and (v) Pressure/Temperature Patterns. Each potential issue is tackled by\r\nidentifying trends and anomalies across the basin using images, tables and plots extracted from the\r\nunstructured data corpus.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nAs an example, the analysis of the (ii) Limited Understanding of Lithology Distribution, shown in\r\nFigure 4, is performed using heatmaps. The heatmaps show the distribution of clastic and carbonates\r\nacross the Bonaparte Basin and identify patterns and anomalies present in the area. The result can be\r\nsupported by the stratigraphic chart where the carbonate environment occurs in the younger formation\r\nfrom Cretaceous to Neogene period, whereas clastic environment is present in the older formations from\r\nTriassic to Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 Lithology distribution on heatmaps (left) and corresponding stratigraphic chart (right).\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the (iii) Limited Mineral Composition Understanding, shown in Figure 5, utilizes the\r\nthin section automatically extracted using ML classification over the full area and suggests that:\r\n\r\nQuartz overgrowth and kaolinite are quite common in Bonaparte Basin\r\n\r\nMica mineral can be observed at the north-eastern part of the basin\r\n\r\nHighly corroded, skeletal feldspar has been extensively dissolved, which forms secondary\r\nporosity, and can be observed in the northern part of the basin\r\n\r\nSome patchy siderites are also observed in the southern part of the basin\r\n\r\nFigure 5 Thin section images distributed on a map across the Bonaparte Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nA regional understanding is critical and time consuming as it involves dealing with a very large data\r\nvolume. Within a project time frame, based on PBE pyramid, the time spent at the Basin Focus stage\r\ncan be reduced, and more time are available to focus on the other project stages. The explorationist will\r\nbe able to bring more value to the study.\r\n\r\nML applications have proven to be able to play a crucial part in order to organize large unstructured\r\ndata corpuses. This allows faster and accurate decision making within the fast-moving industry.\r\n\r\nIn this study, some potential issues encountered during exploration of the Bonaparte Basin can be\r\nidentified. Based on a quick look and gathering of all information it can be concluded that most of the\r\nproduction in the Bonaparte Basin is from Jurassic and Triassic with observed net pay ~18-60m\r\nthickness, porosity ~11-29% and saturation ~11-55% Sw.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nHernandez N., Lucafias P., Graciosa J.C., Mamador C., and Panganiban L.
