The EU has pledged to become the first carbon\r\nneutral continent by 2050, and more than 110 other countries\r\nhave pledged carbon neutrality by this time. Several energy com-\r\npanies have laid out their medium-to-long-term plans towards\r\nthis objective, which includes acquisition of renewables assets,\r\nand developing competitive technologies for carbon capture and\r\nstorage (CCS) and hydrogen production. Among the companies\r\nthat have set zero-emissions targets are BP, Shell, Total, Repsol,\r\nEquinor and Petronas. This energy pivot will require significant\r\ncapital spending to reach the goals.\r\n\r\nTo determine the technical and economic feasibility of these\r\nnew energy technologies and at the same time achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals, multivariate earth data, both existing and\r\nnew, are required and are key to making the right management\r\nand investment decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthDoc pointing to the future:\r\nTo this end, more than 39 years of conference proceedings and\r\npublications are already available from EAGE through Earth-\r\nDoc, which aggregates a wealth of subsurface information from\r\nresearch institutions, energy companies, service companies\r\nand dedicated professionals. The 70,000 scientific publications\r\nfocus on conventional topics within geoscience and engineering\r\nespecially in relation to oil and gas extraction. This subsurface\r\ninformation can be upcycled to provide highly valuable insights\r\nfor new energy technologies. The reuse of existing oil and\r\ngas data reduces data acquisition costs, which translate into a\r\nreduction in research and development costs.\r\n\r\nThrough a collaboration between Iraya Energies and EAGE, a\r\nnew database initiative has been launched with EarthDocs repository of 70,000 scientific publications being processed using the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques\r\nand initially available to institutional and corporate subscribers.\r\nThe whole data corpus is made instantly accessible and provides\r\nnew tools to search and retrieve the diversity of information that\r\none is looking for across any technical discipline.\r\n\r\nWith Big Data analytics applied to the entire data corpus of\r\n70,000 scientific publications, additional in-depth and advanced\r\nnavigation options are now available.\r\n\r\nTo extract information on a large scale, the ElasticDocs AI\r\npipeline is applied to the EarthDoc corpus. This pipeline consists\r\nof a set of algorithms which are used to identify blocks/segments\r\nwithin the document corpus. Optical Character Recognition\r\n(OCR) is applied to the text segments to convert them into\r\nprocessable text. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)\r\nalgorithm pipeline classifies the images into various generic and\r\ngeological image classes, including tables, seismic, map, well\r\nplots, stratigraphic charts, core, thin sections, image logs, and\r\nrose diagrams. Untagged images are generically categorized as\r\nfigures and remain accessible to the user.\r\n\r\nThe ingested documents are now available as structured\r\ninformation for analysis, which is possible in different ways:\r\n\r\n+ Metadata extraction of relevant information such as locations,\r\nnames etc.\r\nEfficient inter and intra-search of the global text corpus for\r\nquantitative textual analysis of document contents to create\r\nautomated and standardized geoscience or engineering content\r\nsummary.\r\nAutomated heatmaps to visualize density of information\r\nwithin a basin or country.\r\nImage extraction of similar image classes for efficient identification \r\nof analogues, duplicates and clusters.\r\n\r\nSome key functionality that has a significant impact on utilizing\r\nthe scientific publications is that not only are images classified\r\naccording to type, but it is possible to do a search on image\r\nembedded text making the search capabilities far more advanced\r\nthan just a normal search-and-find option. The search results of\r\nthis database are exportable as .csv files making statistical work\r\nand analysis instantly possible across data points.\r\n\r\n\r\nProprietary corporate data meets published scientific knowledge:\r\nRecognizing that energy companies hold valuable information in\r\ntheir repositories accumulated throughout many decades of oper-\r\nations, the data kept internally can now be easily integrated with\r\npublished geoscience and engineering data. The combination of\r\n\r\ndatabase results in a two-way enrichment process between public\r\nand private information. Scientific studies from peers in related\r\nfields offer additional information that either validates internal\r\ncompany studies, or offer alternative technical perspectives from\r\nindustry experts.\r\n\r\nIn the Figure 1 example above, we show how exploring\r\ntemperature information available in a Final Well Reports repos-\r\nitory that is commonly considered as proprietary corporate data,\r\nis combined with published EarthDoc contents. (Data source:\r\nNOPIMS)\r\n\r\nFigure 3 Visualization of knowledge graph illustrates\r\nrelated geological and engineering concepts.\r\n\r\nSeveral Earth readability tools are deployed in ED2K to\r\namplify EarthDoc capabilities. This includes access to digital\r\ntextual content, the ability to quality control OCR results and\r\nread in multiple languages via machine-translate. Word clouds are\r\nsimple context clues which provide a quick summary of content\r\nof the articles.\r\n\r\nThe full ED2K corpus is geotagged to more than 800\r\ngeological basins around the world. The geotagging is one of the\r\nmost complex machine learning tasks in this implementation,\r\nbecause the scientific articles contain both location of the\r\ngeological area of interest, as well as the location of confer-\r\nences where the publications are presented. Often, these two\r\nreference locations are different and introduce ambiguity for the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAnother feature that is implemented is the knowledge graph\r\nvisualization. It illustrates the connectivity of  related concepts \r\nbased on publication references. In the example above, it shows\r\n operational excellence ,  optimization  and  engineering suc-\r\ncess  within the same network (Figure 3). Similarly,  hydraulic\r\nfracture stimulation ,  natural fracture interaction , and  Jurassic\r\ncarbonates  show connectivity. In theory, a knowledge graph can\r\nbe built in multiple ways by the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilizing ED2K to reach the zero-emission goal\r\nThe advanced access in the new database makes possible a new\r\nuse of the highly valuable subsurface information and facilitates\r\ncross-discipline usage.\r\n\r\nMany of the new cross-function usages of the existing\r\nscientific publication repository are geothermal energy, hydrogen\r\nenergy, CCS and windmill foundation derisking.\r\n\r\nA query for  carbon capture and storage  generates an\r\ninformation heat map captured in Figure 4. The map shows the\r\ngeographical distribution of the resulting publications either\r\nbased on country or basin.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 maps out the major carbon capture projects around\r\nthe world vis-a-vis needs requirement, Europe and US show high\r\nactivity in CCS initiatives, which are driven by government poli-\r\ncy. Comparing Figure 4 and Figure 5 (left), it may be incidental,\r\n\r\nalthough not entirely surprising that where there is a significant\r\namount of data to aid technical and management decision maKing, \r\nCCS implementations are also active.\r\n\r\nThe new database contains climate change and greenhouse\r\ngases industry discussion materials spanning over three decades.\r\nAlready between 1990 and 2000, the possibility of disposing\r\ncarbon dioxide (CO,) is discussed in papers such as J. Leeb. W,\r\n(1993), and Wildenborg, F.B., et. al., (1996), in conjunction with\r\nthe use of CO, for improved oil recovery methods (IOR).\r\n\r\nBetween 2001 and 2010, the discussions tackled issues in\r\nestablishing a geological storage hub (Espie, 2000) and various\r\npotential site feasibility studies (Gregersen et. al, 2000), costs\r\n(Wildenborg et. al, 2000), use of seismic monitoring (Benson,\r\n2003), (Gosselet et. al., 2006), pilot and numerical simulations\r\n(Domitrovic et. al., 2005), (Battistelli et.al, 2005), reservoir\r\nperformance (Broad et.al, 2007) and improving facilities perfor-\r\nmance to reduce operating costs in CO, and H,S contaminated\r\nfields (Swatton et. al, 2009).\r\n\r\nFrom 2011 up to the present, with the advancements in\r\nseismic methods, reservoir modelling techniques and laboratory\r\nexperiments (Bolourinejad, 2013} many more complex analyses\r\non the subject of carbon storage were performed. Combined with\r\nenhanced oil recovery experiments (EOR), the amount of data\r\nmodelling CO, behavior underground has multiplied ten-fold.\r\n\r\nIn areas where it is not possible to implement subsurface\r\ncarbon capture, utilization strategies are discussed by Harsh, A.\r\net. al (2014) on the industrial usage of CO, including, but not\r\nlimited to, polymer processing and chemicals production.\r\n\r\nFor a deeper dive in the corpus, we draw an arbitrary areal\r\npolygon, indicated by the yellow box in Figure 5, around South\r\nEast Asia.

These include graphical\r\ninformation of PVT analyses, miscibility, flow rates, and time-\r\nlapse pressure profiles, which are useful for reservoir simulation\r\nstudies focused on the interaction of reservoir rocks with CO,\r\nduring injection. Also available are petrography data that makes\r\nit easier to interpret reservoir modelling results by being able\r\nto look at the structural fabric of the storage rocks down to\r\nmicroscopic levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew energy from old data:\r\nWith this data-driven strategy it will be possible to facilitate the\r\npivot to new energy from valuable existing data. No part of the\r\ndata is left unprocessed. It may be that not all relevant informa-\r\ntion will exist within the 70,000 scientific publications, but this\r\ncan be confirmed instantly saving valuable time and resources\r\ndoing data exploration. On the other hand, if the information is\r\navailable, it will be immediately accessible, trackable and put\r\ninto context with other relevant information and geographically.\r\nFor example, the geothermal gradient is a key parameter of\r\ninterest in relation to geothermal energy. The temperature data in\r\n\r\nthe new database has been acquired by energy companies mostly\r\nfor the purpose of understanding the hydrocarbon generation\r\nwindow, petrophysical interpretation and reservoir modelling\r\nanalyses. They can be relooked at for further exploratory geo-\r\nthermal applications. It currently excludes temperature data from\r\ngeothermal companies.\r\n\r\nWe are barely scratching the surface on the data and insights\r\navailable   multiple data stories are waiting to be reimagined,\r\nreconnected and retold in the context of the future of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccelerating internal digitalization initiatives:\r\nAll the elements of the new database are stored and structured\r\nin a digital data warehouse. They will be optionally available\r\nas an API link to be used for additional geological analysis,\r\ndata analytics, or machine learning experimentations. Already\r\nin structured format, they can be fed into additional natural lan-\r\nguage processing or image segmentation processing for in-house\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpportunity for the energy geoscientists and engineers of the future:\r\nWhile the energy industry has faced significant headwinds, it is\r\nnow moving faster than ever towards new, cleaner energy pro-\r\nduction.
