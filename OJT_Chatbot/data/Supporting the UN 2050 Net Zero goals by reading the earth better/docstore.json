Kim Gunn Maver ! and Charmyne Mamador present the ED2K\ninitiative providing multivariate earth data to support UN climate change goals .\n\nIntroduction\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the current global pandemic the UN\n2050 net zero goals call for global greenhouse emissions to be cut\nby half by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050 to achieve\nthe goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius above prein\ndustrial levels . The EU has pledged to become the first carbon\nneutral continent by 2050 and more than 110 other countries\nhave pledged carbon neutrality by this time . Several energy com\npanies have laid out their mediumtolongterm plans towards\nthis objective which includes acquisition of renewables assets\nand developing competitive technologies for carbon capture and\nstorage ( CCS ) and hydrogen production . Among the companies\nthat have set zeroemissions targets are BP Shell Total Repsol\nEquinor and Petronas . This energy pivot will require significant\ncapital spending to reach the goals .\n\nTo determine the technical and economic feasibility of these\nnew energy technologies and at the same time achieve sustainable\ndevelopment goals multivariate earth data both existing and\nnew are required and are key to making the right management\nand investment decisions .\n\nEarthDoc pointing to the future\n\nTo this end more than 39 years of conference proceedings and\npublications are already available from EAGE through Earth\nDoc which aggregates a wealth of subsurface information from\nresearch institutions energy companies service companies\nand dedicated professionals . The 70000 scientific publications\nfocus on conventional topics within geoscience and engineering\nespecially in relation to oil and gas extraction . This subsurface\ninformation can be upcycled to provide highly valuable insights\nfor new energy technologies . The reuse of existing oil and\ngas data reduces data acquisition costs which translate into a\nreduction in research and development costs .\n\nThrough a collaboration between Iraya Energies and EAGE a\nnew database initiative has been launched with EarthDocs repos\nitory of 70000 scientific publications being processed using the\nlatest in machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques\nand initially available to institutional and corporate subscribers .\nThe whole data corpus is made instantly accessible and provides\nnew tools to search and retrieve the diversity of information that\none is looking for across any technical discipline .\n\nIraya Energies\nCorresponding author Email : nmh @ irayaenergies.com\nDOl : 10.399713652397.fb2021045\n\nWith Big Data analytics applied to the entire data corpus of\n70000 scientific publications additional indepth and advanced\nnavigation options are now available .\n\nTo extract information on a large scale the ElasticDocs AI\npipeline is applied to the EarthDoc corpus . This pipeline consists\nof a set of algorithms which are used to identify blockssegments\nwithin the document corpus . Optical Character Recognition\n( OCR ) is applied to the text segments to convert them into\nprocessable text . A Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( DCNN )\nalgorithm pipeline classifies the images into various generic and\ngeological image classes including tables seismic map well\nplots stratigraphic charts core thin sections image logs and\nrose diagrams . Untagged images are generically categorized as\nfigures and remain accessible to the user .\n\nThe ingested documents are now available as structured\ninformation for analysis which is possible in different ways :\n\nMetadata extraction of relevant information such as locations\nnames etc .\n\nEfficient inter and intrasearch of the global text corpus for\nquantitative textual analysis of document contents to create\nautomated and standardized geoscience or engineering content\nsummary .\n\nAutomated heatmaps to visualize density of information\nwithin a basin or country .\n\nImage extraction of similar image classes for efficient identifi\ncation of analogues duplicates and clusters .\n\nSome key functionality that has a significant impact on utilizing\nthe scientific publications is that not only are images classified\naccording to type but it is possible to do a search on image\nembedded text making the search capabilities far more advanced\nthan just a normal searchandfind option . The search results of\nthis database are exportable as .csv files making statistical work\nand analysis instantly possible across data points .\n\nProprietary corporate data meets published\nscientific knowledge .\n\nRecognizing that energy companies hold valuable information in\ntheir repositories accumulated throughout many decades of oper\nations the data kept internally can now be easily integrated with\npublished geoscience and engineering data .

Comparing Figure 4 and Figure 5 ( left ) it may be incidental\nalthough not entirely surprising that where there is a significant\namount of data to aid technical and management decision mak\ning CCS implementations are also active .\n\nMAP KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\n\nResults Density\n\nThe new database contains climate change and greenhouse\ngases industry discussion materials spanning over three decades .\nAlready between 1990 and 2000 the possibility of disposing\ncarbon dioxide ( CO ) is discussed in papers such as J. Leeb . W\n( 1993 ) and Wildenborg F.B . et . al . ( 1996 ) in conjunction with\nthe use of CO for improved oil recovery methods ( IOR ) .\n\nBetween 2001 and 2010 the discussions tackled issues in\nestablishing a geological storage hub ( Espie 2000 ) and various\npotential site feasibility studies ( Gregersen et . al 2000 ) costs\n( Wildenborg et . al 2000 ) use of seismic monitoring ( Benson\n2003 ) ( Gosselet et . al . 2006 ) pilot and numerical simulations\n( Domitrovic et . al . 2005 ) ( Battistelli et.al 2005 ) reservoir\nperformance ( Broad et.al 2007 ) and improving facilities perfor\nmance to reduce operating costs in CO and HS contaminated\nfields ( Swatton et . al 2009 ) .\n\nFrom 2011 up to the present with the advancements in\nseismic methods reservoir modelling techniques and laboratory\nexperiments ( Bolourinejad 2013 ) many more complex analyses\non the subject of carbon storage were performed . Combined with\nenhanced oil recovery experiments ( EOR ) the amount of data\nmodelling CO behavior underground has multiplied tenfold .\n\nIn areas where it is not possible to implement subsurface\ncarbon capture utilization strategies are discussed by Harsh A .\net . al ( 2014 ) on the industrial usage of CO including but not\nlimited to polymer processing and chemicals production .\n\nFor a deeper dive in the corpus we draw an arbitrary areal\npolygon indicated by the yellow box in Figure 5 around South\nEast Asia . Our new database reveals some of the strategies\nthat have been identified by an operator to manage greenhouse\nemissions in its operations in Malaysia ( Mehta et.al.2008 ) .\nThis includes among others ending continuous gas flaring\n\nFigure 4 Indicative geolocation of global knowledge\nabout carbon capture and storage between 2008\nto 2020 .\n\nFigure 5 Location of major carbon capture projects\naround the world ( left ) and the requirement index\nbased on fossil fuel production and consumption\n( right ) .

These include graphical\ninformation of PVT analyses miscibility flow rates and time\nlapse pressure profiles which are useful for reservoir simulation\nstudies focused on the interaction of reservoir rocks with CO\nduring injection . Also available are petrography data that makes\nit easier to interpret reservoir modelling results by being able\nto look at the structural fabric of the storage rocks down to\nmicroscopic levels .\n\nNew energy from old data\nWith this datadriven strategy it will be possible to facilitate the\npivot to new energy from valuable existing data . No part of the\ndata is left unprocessed . It may be that not all relevant informa\ntion will exist within the 70000 scientific publications but this\ncan be confirmed instantly saving valuable time and resources\ndoing data exploration . On the other hand if the information is\navailable it will be immediately accessible trackable and put\ninto context with other relevant information and geographically .\nFor example the geothermal gradient is a key parameter of\ninterest in relation to geothermal energy . The temperature data in\n\nthe new database has been acquired by energy companies mostly\nfor the purpose of understanding the hydrocarbon generation\nwindow petrophysical interpretation and reservoir modelling\nanalyses . They can be relooked at for further exploratory geo\nthermal applications .
