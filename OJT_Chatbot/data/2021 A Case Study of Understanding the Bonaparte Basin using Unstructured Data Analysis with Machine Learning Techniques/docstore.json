As a result geoscientists and engineers spend 50 to 80945 of\ntheir time searching and assembling data and only 1 to 5Y0 of the data is fully utilized . The value of\ntechnical work is therefore reduced due to the lack of time available for analysis and critical thinking\nand the underutilization of the data . To assist geoscientist and engineers Machine Learning ( ML )\nand Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) technologies are applied to process the unstructured data making it\npossible to perform more accurate analysis and make faster decisions .\n\nIn this case study the area of interest covers Bonaparte Basin which is located northwest of\nthe Australian continental margin ( Figure 1 ) . It joins the Money Shoal basin in the northeast and\nthe Browse Basin in the southwest . Furthermore the Timor Trough defines the northern boundary .\nThe areal extent of the basin is approximately 270000 sq . km . The objective of this study is to\nunderstand and obtain meaningful insights into the Bonaparte Basin based on the substantial amount\nof information available in previous studies reports and presentations . The unstructured data of the\nBonaparte Basin have been ingested in a Knowledge Container through consecutive ML and AI\npipelines and analysed using big data analytics tools .\n\nConsist of several structural elements :\n@ ) Ashmore Platform @ Malita Graben\n@ Vulcan SubBasin @ sahul Platform\n@ Londonderry High @ ) Flamingo High\n@ Petrel Subbasin @ ) Flamingo Syncline\n@ Darwin Shelf @ ) Sahul Syncline\n( 6 ) Calder Graben @ Nancar Trough\n@ ) Troubadour Terrace 14 ) Laminaria High\n\nFigure 1 Location of the Bonaparte Basin within the Australian continental margin ( left ) and 14\nstructural elements observed within the Bonaparte Basin ( right ) .\n\nMethodology\n\nAs of 2021 the Bonaparte Basin encompasses 440 wells representing 58 years of exploration history\nsummarized in over 270000 pages of documents and in 250000 images . It is estimated that billions of\ndollars have been invested over the years to acquire and interprete the data making it a substantial\nsource of information for new exploration activities .\n\nThe Play Based Exploration ( PBE ) approach is often used as a traditional framework to refine the\ngeoscientistss understanding from a broad basin level to a narrow prospect focus ( Lottaroli et al . 2016 ) .\nAs a start such an approach often involves capturing the current state of knowledge with massive\nbackground resources to understand and analyse the key features of the basin and the major risks\nassociated to it . Such information is primarily available in unstructured data requiring geoscientist and\nengineers to process and ingest the information before focusing on a specific play and prospect using\nstructured data . Therefore we have modified the existing PBE pyramid to introduce an additional\n\n82rd EAGE Amnual Conference 42 Exhibition\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\n82ND CONFERENCE 8 EXHIBITION\nAMSTERDAM THE NETHERLANDS\n\ndimension associated with data science identifying the different types of data available at different\nstages allowing us to better define the best suited MLAI strategy for a given stage ( Figure 2 ) .\n\nProspect Specific chance\n\nProspect focus\n\nSTRUCTU RED u Image Map Evaluate chance that a particular prospect will\nProspects become\na discovery in case play works .\n\n\nPa Play Focus Play Chance\nS m Identity limits of the single play elements The chance that a particular play\nworks hence the chance of its\nUNSTRUCTURED ai Cana bagi song In presenca ang elements ( e.g . reservoir seal source )\nefteciiveness o ! each element of being present and effective over an\n( Commmon Risk Segment Mapping ) area ( play se o )\nm Analyse play statistics . 9\n\nDetermination and description of the\nRegional context and Basin\nFramework .\nUnderstanding of the Petroleum\nsystem ( s )\n\nBasin Focus\n\nu Assess the possibility a play may\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n( Play Fairway Mapping ) !\n\n\n\n\n\npi\n\n\n\n\ni\nexists in a basin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 6237, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "585bde29-6afb-4f5e-9fd0-f14ae9559fa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "585bde29-6afb-4f5e-9fd0-f14ae9559fa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "2021 A Case Study of Understanding the Bonaparte Basin using Unstructured Data Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques", "author": ["A.N.N .

Each potential issue is tackled by\nidentifying trends and anomalies across the basin using images tables and plots extracted from the\nunstructured data corpus .\n\nResults\n\nAs an example the analysis of the ( 11 ) Limited Understanding of Lithology Distribution shown in\nFigure 4 is performed using heatmaps . The heatmaps show the distribution of clastic and carbonates\nacross the Bonaparte Basin and identify patterns and anomalies present in the area . The result can be\nsupported by the stratigraphic chart where the carbonate environment occurs in the younger formation\nfrom Cretaceous to Neogene period whereas clastic environment is present in the older formations from\nTriassic to Cretaceous .\n\ndation\n\nBreakup\n\nasal transgressive snadstone Limestone\nAnG aharino Yheit sana Rin\n\n4 Marine claystone and shale EE Mari\n\nModified from Frankowicz 8 : McClay 2009\n\nFigure 4 Lithology distribution on heatmaps ( left ) and corresponding stratigraphic chart ( right ) .\n\nThe analysis of the ( iii ) Limited Mineral Composition Understanding shown in Figure 5 utilizes the\nthin section automatically extracted using ML classification over the full area and suggests that :\n\ne.

Within a project time frame based on PBE pyramid the time spent at the Basin Focus stage\ncan be reduced and more time are available to focus on the other project stages . The explorationist will\nbe able to bring more value to the study .\n\nML applications have proven to be able to play a crucial part in order to organize large unstructured\ndata corpuses . This allows faster and accurate decision making within the fastmoving industry .\n\nIn this study some potential issues encountered during exploration of the Bonaparte Basin can be\nidentified . Based on a quick look and gathering of all information it can be concluded that most of the\nproduction in the Bonaparte Basin is from Jurassic and Triassic with observed net pay 1860m\nthickness porosity 112946 and saturation 115546 Sw .\n\nReferences\n\nHernandez N.
