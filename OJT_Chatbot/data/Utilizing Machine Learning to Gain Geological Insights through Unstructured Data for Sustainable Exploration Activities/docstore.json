One way to gain a sound knowledge about the geology and the\nexploration history is to analyse the vast amount of data accumulated over the years in an unstructured\nmanner . A sustainable data driven strategy leveraging on the latest advancement of Machine Learning\n( ML ) and Analytics is applied on vast amount of unstructured data . By highlighting the data driven\nstrategy the paper demonstrates such a strategy applied to presalt carbonates prospects located in the\nCampos and Santos Basins offshore Brazil . The interpretation framework consists of first step to\nidentify the regional first order trends and second step to recognize the second order anomalies over\nthe full area providing a holistic picture of the area of interest .\n\nMethodology\n\nThe unstructured data comprise of more than 48000 documents primarily in Portuguese language for\na total of 330000 pages related to 50 years of exploration covering the Campos and Santos Basins . The\nmethodologies are divided into two parts . In the part one methodology the unstructured data is\nprocessed using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) for name\nentity recognition and language translation and Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( DCNN ) for auto\nimage recognition ( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) . In part two methodology ML Analytics leverages the\nvisualization for data relationships to give a holistic view of the whole corpus ( Baillard et al . 2021 ) .\nThree steps study is used here as explained below with illustration at Figure 1 .\n\ne Step 1 : Deep Search through text is the ability to use keywords search within the whole corpus\nand filter the wanted results . Filtered information is easily accessible for investigation . Deep\nSearch is also applied for images . DCNN image recognition and classification techniques classify\nthe images into eight categories : thin section core well plot seismic stratigraphic structural\nelements map table and figure . A deep search allows user to search information tagged and\nidentified in these images . This step is to identify the geological and exploration challenges\nrelated to the area of interest .\n\ne Step 2 : Heat Map highlights the hot zones on map based on the frequency of the keywords\nfound . Drawing a polygon on the map allows user to confine the search to focus only in the zone\nof their interest . On the other hand instant text search through the whole corpus of English and\nPortuguese documents is possible with the automated translation . Users able to search through\nPortuguese documents using English keywords .\n\ne Step 3 : Contextual Knowledge Graph illustrates the connectivity of related corpuses based on\nwell name referencing . This is useful to obtain related information from different wells\n( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) . Besides that Intuition provides clustered images view a great approach\nto discover analogues for alike images such as thin section core SEM and biomarker .\n\nHeat Map displays the Information correlation using\nconcentration of the search results Knowledge Graph\n\nta . a\nu y\nPasa .\n\nNa Ki\n\nDeep Search within documents and\nexport CSV\n\nNg\nG\n\n.\n\nDeep Search through images and\nretrieve\n\n\ni\n\n# Analogs identification using\nImage Clustering\n\nAutomated translation of Portuguese\n\nH\nBRP ...\n\nina pinamatrinasrhasutang\nmo af\n\nFigure 1 The data driven search strategy implementing the ML Analytics for visualization of data\nrelationships for a holistic view of whole corpus\n\nEAGE Conference on Digital Innovation for a Sustainable Future\n13 15 September 2022 Bangkok Thailand\n\n-----Page 2-----\n\nEAGE\n\nCase study : Understanding the PreSalt Carbonate Regional Trends and Anomalies in Campos\nand Santos Basins\n\nThe Campos and Santos Basins located to the east offshore of Brazil are some of the most prolific oil\nand gas basins in the world with significant discoveries such as Tupi Jupiter and Libra Fields . The\ninvestigation of the 50 years of presalt exploration history contained in the 48000 documents processed\nrevealed that most of the challenges during exploration are caused by 1 . Fluid distribution 2 . The\nreservoir quality 3 . CO and H5S presence 4 . Overpressure patterns .\n\n1 . Campos and Santos Basins are showing a variable fluid distribution . The type and quality of\nthe fluid trends are keys to define the best target for a sustainable development .\n\n2 . The diagenesis affects the reservoir quality . A good visualization of the lateral distribution of\nsuch process allows a better estimation of the porosity and the volume in place .\n\n3 . The regional gas issues such as understanding the presence of CO and HoS is essential to\ngauge the reservoir diagenesis properties as well as to plan for production facilities or to avoid\nregions of sour and hazardous gaseous .\n\n4 . The irregularity in the thickness of the salt layer causes variability in the pressure regime with\noverpressure over the zone of interest and affecting the drilling campaigns .\n\nThese challenges are relevant to understand the geology and production issues encountered in distinct\nparts of the basins to improve sustainable in the exploration risk and reducing CO footprint .\n\nFor the presalt oil trendings Campos presalt generally has lighter oil compared to Santos presalt . As\nfor the anomalies light oil or condensate discovery at Pau De Acucar Seat and Gavea Fields in Campos\npresalt while heavy mostly found in the postsalt in the Southern Campos . In Santos heavy oil reported\nin Jupiter Field . Note that heavy oil also discovered in Atlanta and Oliva Fields at postsalt .

The oil API delineation is based\non Deep Search extraction from test reports for Santos ( left map ) and Campos ( right map ) . Knowledge\nGraph was analyzed to find a group of fields that share the light oil information Gavea Seat and Pao\nde Acucar Fields .\n\nNext we study the facies distribution at presalt carbonate . A collection of core and thin section images\nare retrieved from the Deep Search through images . In general it is observed that the reservoir\nformation is in the shrub facies microbiolites and coquina . For the trendingss the area with COo\nleaching activities enhance the porosity example in the Libra Buzios Fields going south to Tupi and\nCarcara Fields in Santos . Fields proximal to the shore has poorer reservoir quality . One of the anomalies\nobserved is the hydrothermal activity can destroy the enhanced porosity by the leaching . The\nhydrothermal activity is anticipated in Field Albacora Carcara based on the observation on the core .\nIllustration in Figure 3 .\n\nEAGE Conference on Digital Innovation for a Sustainable Future\n13 15 September 2022 Bangkok Thailand\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\nEAGE\n\nMEROLIBRA\nMicrobial carbonates in\n\nsag sequence and coquina\nrift sequence\n\nITAIPU\nShrub facies\n\nic Calcarenite\nshows good porosity due\nto leaching\n\nALBACORA\n..

The formation data points are quickly extracted from\nunstructured data over 80 wells using Deep Search . The points are then plotted on gradient psift ranging\nfrom 0.35 to 0.7 psift . Based on the pressure gradient validation wells in Carcara Sagitario and\nCorcovado Fields have exceptionally high formation pressure . An interpretation of fullstack PSDM\ncrosssection shows thick salt area in Carcara and Sagitario possible with faulting causes saline water\nintrusion which contribute to high pressure zone . Irregularity in thickness of salt layer causes variability\nin pressure regime such as overpressure area to take note as this will have an impact on seismic\ninterpretation and drilling campaign .

New tools in MLAI and Analytics provides a new exploration frontier for\nsubsurface experts allowing them to interrogate and visualize a vast amount of data previously scattered\nin different format and location holistically .\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe would like to thank PETRONAS Petroleo Brasil LTDA for the collaboration with Iraya Energies\nto makes this paper possible .
