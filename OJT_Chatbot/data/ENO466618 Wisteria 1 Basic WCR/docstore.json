The well is located some 690 km west of Darwin and\napproximately 20 km east of the Skua Oil Field and 25 km north east of the Montara\nOil Field ( Figure 1 ) .\n\nThe rotary table elevation of the West Atlas was 38.1 metres . Unless stated\notherwise depth measurements in this report are Drillers depths with respect to the\nrotary table and are referenced as mMDRT . Sea level reference is Australian Height\nDatum ( AHD ) .\n\nWisteria1 was spudded at 13:00 Hrs on 22 August 2008 . Water depth at the\nlocation was 96.5 metres AHD . A 914 mm surface hole was drilled to 174.0 mMDRT\nand a 762 mm x 508 mm ( 30 x 20 ) tapered conductor was set at 168.5 mMDRT .\n\n445mm ( 17 72 ) hole was drilled with returns to the sea to 1670.0 mMDRT . 340mm\n( 13 38 ) casing was run and cemented at 1645.7 mMDRT and the BOP installed and\ntested .\n\n311mm ( 12 4 ) hole was drilled ( 9 bit runs ) to a TD of 3281.0 mMDRT ( 15 September\n2008 ) . FEWD logs ( Gamma RayResistivityDensityPorosity ) were run to 2805.0\nmMDRT . Below this depth only Gamma Ray and Resistivity tools were run due to a\nfailure of the DensityPorosity tool .\n\nAt TD 2 wireline logging runs were conducted as follows :\n\nRun 1 : Checkshot survey\nRun 2 : GRTLDCNLDSI\n\nThe well was then plugged and abandoned and the rig went off contract when on tow 1\n\nkm from the Wisteria1 location at 08:00 hours on the 22 September 2008 after 32.5\ndays on location .\n\nWisteria1 WCR Basic Data\n\n-----Page 6-----\n\nWisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )\n\nFigure 1 : Wisteria1 Location Map\n\n12430 FE Hadrosaurus 173ff Eclipse\n\nWisteria1\nlocation\n\nUpdip Longleat\nongleat 1\n\nSAnderdon 1\n@ Katers 1\n\nID Prospects\nip Stratigraphic\nProspects .\n\n4\n\nGConway 1\n\n0 10km\na\n\nWisteria1 WCR Basic Data\n\n-----Page 7-----\n\nTable 1 Wisteria1 Well Data\n\nWell :\n\nLicence :\n\nWisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )\n\nWisteria1\n\nACIP32\n\nName and Address of\nOperator :\n\nName of Venturer ( s ) :\n\nCoogee Resources ( Ashmore Cartier ) Pty Ltd\n\nLevel 1 HPPL House\n2842 Ventnor Ave\nWest Perth WA 6005\n\nCoogee Resources ( Ashmore Cartier ) Pty Ltd\nCosmo Energy Exploration 4 Development Ltd\n\nBharat PetroResources Ltd\nWestranch Holdings Pty Ltd\nAdelphi Energy Limited\nBounty Oil 4 Gas NL\n\nFinal Well Coordinates :\n\nLongitude : 124 38 38.422 E\nLatitude : 1229 49.361S\nFasting : 678652.80 mE\nNorthing : 8617 928.40 MN\n\nSeismic Reference :\nDrilling Rig :\n\nWater Depth :\nRotary Table :\n\nSeismic Location : Inline 8534 : Xline 6971\nWest Atlas\n\n96.5 m\n\n38.1 m\n\nDate Rig Contract\nCommenced :\n\nRig on Location :\nSpud Date :\n\nCasing Shoes :\n762508mm ( 3020 )\n\n340mm ( 13.375 )\n\n20 !

OPERATIONS SUMMARY\n\nThe rig came on hire to Coogee Resources ( Ashmore Cartier ) Pty Ltd for Wisteria1\nwhen 1 km from the Swallow1 location which occurred at 20:00 Hrs ( CST ) on 20\nAugust 2008 . The rig was towed to the Wisteria1 location and was positioned and\npinned at 05:30 hours on 21 ? August 2008 . The rig was pre loaded without incident\nbefore jacking up to operating height in preparation for drilling . The final well position\nwas 4.79 m on a bearing of 23.4 ( True ) from the intended location and the rig heading\nwas 224.6 ( True ) . The water depth at the location was 96.5m and the rig elevation\nwas 36.1m .\n\nThe 914 mm ( 36 ) spud assembly was run and the well spudded at 13:00 hours on the\n22 August 2008 . The 914660 mm ( 3626 ) hole section was drilled to 172.0\nmMDRT and the 762 x 508 mm ( 30 x 20 ) tapered conductor run and set with the\nshoe at 168.1 mMDRT ( Figure 2 ) .\n\n# # Note : the conductor hung up 1.5m above landing depth and as a result the rig was\njacked up 2.0 m to allow for the conductor space out ( new RT elevation 38.1mm ) .\n\nThe top of the 762 mm ( 30 ) conductor was set just above the sea bed and a 508 mm\n( 20 ) riser was run back to the rig . The riser had ports located just below sea level\nwhich were designed to allow returns to dissipate away from the well at the seabed\nand also provide an auto fill ! mechanism should loss of returns be encountered in the\n445 mm ( 17 72 ) hole section .\n\nA 445mm ( 17 72 ) hole was drilled vertically to a section TD of 1670.0 mMDRT and the\ndrilling assembly was pulled out of the hole and the 340mm ( 13 38 ) casing was run\nand cemented with the shoe set at 1645.7 mMDRT .\n\nThe 340mm ( 13 38 ) casing was drilled out with a dumb drilling assembly ( MWD tools\nlate arriving on the rig ) to 1739.0 mMDRT and a Formation Integrity Test conducted\nbefore pulling out to pick up the MWD tools . The 311 mm ( 12 4 ) hole section was\nthen drilled with a motor ( 0.78 ? bend ) and FEWD tools for the acquisition of gamma\nray resistivity porosity and density data . The logging tools were wiped over the\npreviously drilled hole section ( 1670.0 to 1739.0 mMDRT ) and drilling then continued\nfrom 1739.0 mMDRT . A small correction in the well path direction was made in order\nto remain within the target tolerance and drilling continued to 2507.0 mMDRT where a\n5 stand wiper trip was conducted ( due to slow penetration rates thought to be from bit\nballing ) . Drilling resumed with improved ROP and continued to 2803.0 mMDRT where\nanother wiper trip was carried out due to slowing ROP . On resuming drilling the ROP\nremained slow ( 2 mhr ) and the decision was made to trip for a new bit at 2805.0\nmMDRT . When loading the source for the density tool at surface prior to running into\nthe hole a problem occurred which required the tool to be laid out . With no back up\navailable the assembly was run into the hole with only Gamma Ray and Resistivity\ntools included . Drilling then continued to 2862.0 mMDRT where the penetration rate\nslowed significantly and at 2872.0 mMDRT ( after 10m of very slow drilling ) a trip was\nmade to change the bit once again . The BHA was changed for this bit run with the\nmotor being taken out in order to allow better rotary control of the bit . Drilling\ncontinued to 2877.0 mMDRT however the ROP remained very slow and a further trip\nwas made to change the bit . An insert rock bit was picked up and run into the hole to\ndrill the hard cemented sandstone and at 2916.0 mMDRT a bit trip was made to pick\nup another PDC bit as the cuttings indicated the bit was back into siltstone ( real time\nGRRes FEWD failed at 2905.0 mMDRT ) . A PDC bit was run into the hole ( FEWD\nGRRes failed shallow test ) but after only about 2.0m more cemented sandstone was\nencountered and after slowly drilling to 2937.0 mMDRT another bit trip was made .\nThe PDC bit was severely rung out and so another insert rock bit was picked up . The\n\nWisteria1 WCR Basic Data\n\n-----Page 9-----\n\nWisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )\n\nrock bit drilled into siltstone ( no real time FEWD data ) and the ROP improved to 6 to 8\nmhr . Between 3088.0 and 3092.0 mMDRT another hard sand was encountered and\nthen after drilling through this at around 2 mhr another trip was made at 3104.0\nmMDRT to pick up a PDC bit . The PDC bit was run into the hole ( GRRes FEWD tools\nreplaced and successfully shallow tested ) and drilled to 3176.0 mMDRT where a\nnutplug pill was pumped to try and improve the ROP . Real time MWD data was lost\nafter pumping the pill however drilling continued slowly to 3194.0 mMDRT where a trip\nwas made to change the bit . A rock bit was picked up and after unsuccessful attempts\nto clean out the MWD pulser the back up Powerpulse tool was picked up in order to\nhave real time Gamma Ray data . Drilling then continued to a TD of 3281.0 mMDRT\nwhich was reached at 21:30 hours on 15 September 2008 . After circulating the hole\nclean the drilling assembly was pulled out of the hole and the FEWD tools laid out .\n\nAt TD 2 wireline logging runs were conducted as follows :\n\nSuite 1 :\nRun 1 : Checkshot survey\nRun 2 : GRTLDCNLDSI\n\nOn completion of wireline logging the well was plugged and abandoned . The casing\nwas cut at 156.0 mMDRT and a seabed survey conducted prior to the rig moving off\nlocation . The rig went off contract at 08:00 hours on the 22 ? September 2008 after\n32.5 days on location .\n\nWisteria1 WCR Basic Data\n\n-----Page 10-----\n\nWisteria1 Well Completion Report ( Basic Data )\n\nFigure 2 .
