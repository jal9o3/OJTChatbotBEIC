Yet many geological information that have already been mined are stored\nin spreadsheets or niche databases that limits their abilities to be recycled for multiple uses within the\norganization . Basin information such as formation pressure formation temperature fracture pressure\ndrilling rate of penetration total organic carbon ( TOC ) and lithologies are some of the typical\nparameters that are crucial to understand the basin scale geology reservoir properties and identify\nopportunities within the area of interest and often needed to perform in depth workflows such as\nseismic reservoir characterization basin modelling and geomechanical studies which cover multiple\ncycles of exploration development and site development of future carbon waste disposals .\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we are going to demonstrate on how we can improve on the traditional data mining\nworkflows and enhance data sustainability by focusing process improvement on three areas : a . )\naccelerating the speed of geoscience parameter extraction by Artificial Intelligence Machine learning\n( AIML ) techniques b . ) increase data readability and integrity by effective visualization of both\nsource and output data and c. ) promote data reusability by enabling API access to extracted data .\n\nMethodology\n\nThe advancement in ML and AI with the support of advancement in cloud computing has made a\nsignificant impact to the traditional data mining workflows . However AIML workflows are typically\nfocused only on the data extraction phase as a onetime effort whereas an effective data mining\nstrategy should also ensure data sustainability which means the ability to visualize the data to identify\ntrends and patterns easily and pass that highintegrity extracted information intact to multiple type of\nusers within the organization .\n\nA sustainable data mining strategy is proposed to accelerate extraction with an automated pipeline\nusing Machine Learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) or Deep\nConvolutional Neural Network ( DCNN ) ingests all the unstructured data ( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) in\nsteps 1 to 3 followed by humaninthe loop quality control visualization and data trackability and\nconnectivity in steps 4 and 5 . ( Figure 1 ) :\n\n1 . A vast amount of unstructured data such as final well report technical reports working files\nthat varies from .pdf .docx . .xIsx .csv jpg .png and .tif are used as the main source of\ninformation and feed into the production ready ML pipelines for audit duplicates and version\ndetections .\n\n2 . The unstructured data ingestion starts with the digitalization of data using Optical Character\nRecognition ( OCR ) . Next Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( DCNN ) classifies the\nextracted images into their respective geological categories such as map seismic\nstratigraphic chart SEM thin section core and well logs . Simultaneously Natural Language\nProcessing ( NLP ) pipeline performs automated extraction and tagging of metadata .\n\n3 . Further analysis and knowledge extraction are available once the unstructured data is\ningested . Data Science analytical tool such as deep search with heat map density allows\nadditional insights where the user can monitor the trend of a parameter regionally . In addition\ntables extracted from the reports are postprocessed to retain the structure and extract the\nvalues .\n\n4 . Missing depth interpolation units standardization and plotting of values on the gradient\nisolines are part of the data validation procedures during the Human in the Loop quality\ncontrol .\n\nAPGCE 2022\nKuala Lumpur Malaysia 28 29 November 2022\nwww.apgce.com\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\n5 . The last step is the discovery stage that allows shareable structured data among the team\nmembers for further interpretation and insights . The final shareable structured data allows\ndata trackability within unstructured data data export functionality spatial filter to confine\nthe search to the area of interest depth filter and outliers identification . The typical outputs\nof data mining exercise are the standard excel or csv as application agnostic format . In this\nstage we also enabled API access to allow for easier connectivity to other geoscience\nplatforms or internally developed digital infrastructure systems .\n\nUnstructured Data MLAl Pipeline and HumanintheLoop Quality Control\n\n1 .

Since there could be conflicting understanding on what is considered right or relevant data at\nthe time the extraction was done it is important to keep the sources of information intact so these can\nbe reviewed and updated when new additional data is available and the geological understanding of\nthe basin of interest has evolved . The two additional steps introduced in the data mining process\nincreases data integrity .\n\nResults\n\nIn this study unstructured data from over 500 oil and gas wells are processed on a regional scale this\nincludes a total of 300000 pages and 140000 images . Six geological parameters formation pressure\nformation temperature fracture pressure drilling rate of penetration total organic carbon ( TOC ) and\nlithologies were efficiently extracted aggregated validated and finally visualized on scatter plots and\npie charts . The output from the case study shows notable knowledge analysis ( Figure 2 ) that provides\ninsights on the regional consistency and information distribution of the area of interest and can be\nused as input into petroleum system modelling reservoir characterization idle wells review\ngeomechanical studies or potential carbon storage studies .\n\nAPGCE 2022\nKuala Lumpur Malaysia 28 29 November 2022\nwww.apgce.com\n\n-----Page 4-----\n\nasia PETROLEUM\n\nFigure 2 Lithological pie chart distribution ( left ) and scatter plots of total organic carbon ( TOC )\nrate of penetration ( ROP ) formation temperature fracture pressure and formation pressure ( right )\n\nConclusions\n\nThe research demonstrates the application of AIML technologies coupled with interactive data\nvisualization and API connectivity that can significantly accelerate the extraction of knowledge that\nare sitting inside the reports and ensure sustainability in data mining activities . In the case study we\nhave presented a workflow on how six ( 6 ) geological parameters from over 500 wells were\nsuccessfully extracted from unstructured data using ML and AI pipelines that can be used by multi\nfaceted subsurface teams for more indepth analysis within the area resulting to the upcycling of\ngeological data across the full life cycle of a basin .\n\nReferences\n\nHernandez N.
