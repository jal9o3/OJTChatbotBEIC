These technical documents contain\nvaluable information from diverse disciplines such as geology geophysics petrophysics reservoir\nengineering drilling and other subject matters and are in general stored in a unstructured format .\n\nEspecially national data management systems and oil companies hosts these large amounts of very\nvaluable historical well data which contain information such as reservoir metadata images texts and\nprocessed information such as lithology geology shows drilling risks etc . Due to the large volume\nvintage variety and nonstandard formats extraction of valuable information which can be used as\ninput for further work is an arduous task as the manual nature of data mining is very timeconsuming .\n\nTo extract and utilize all this well data a machine learningenabled platform has been developed as a\nhybrid cloud container that automatically reads and understands hundreds or thousands of technical\ndocuments with little human supervision . The aim of the platform is to ease the identification of\nimportant parts of the technical documents automatically extract relevant information and visualize it\nfor the user so they can easily do further analysis share it with colleagues or agnostically port it to\nother platforms as input .\n\nMethodology\n\nThe platform utilizes a hybrid data service architecture which leverages the 2tier strength of both\ncloud and private servers . The hybrid architecture serves to :\n\nEnhance the platforms security and data privacy by storing raw data locally\nIncrease data shareability in realtime by utilizing a cloud solution\n\nReduce data redundancy and increase data integrity among users\n\nProvide a pragmatic solution to optimize data storage costs\n\nThe user can upload raw data to the platform which are stored on a private local server . The machine\nlearning algorithms are activated and implement the necessary processing and workflows . Structured\ndata is generated as output which are pushed through to a search engine that is accessible to the user\nin the cloud ( Figure 1 ) .\n\nKD\nObje\n\nRaw Input Data\nStorage Wu ct\n\nMachine Learning\nAlgorithms\n\nFigure 1 The hybrid architecture of platform ( ElasticDocs ) utilizing the 2tier strength of local and\ncloud sever applications for data security integrity and shareability . Carefully selected machine\nlearning sequence for automated text and image analysis include : optical character recognition deep\nconvolutional neural network and image clustering .\n\nFirst EAGEPESGB Workshop on Machine Learning\n2930 November 2018 London UK\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\nPES 463 EAGE\n\nThe platform capitalizes on the machine learning algorithms that automatically process the\nunstructured data into a condensed format in which only preselected information are stored . The\nmachine learning algorithms employs a unique sequence of separate steps which are setup to mimic\nthe human experience of processing unstructured documents .\n\nWorkflow\n\nA Norwegian dataset consisting of 400 well reports ( 58000 pages ) and an Australian well database\nconsisting of 6000 pages have been used as training data for generating structured data .\n\nFor the unstructured data the first machine learning step is the digitization and conversion of .pdf or\n.docx file formats into an editable format . This conversion uses Optical Character Recognition ( OCR )\nwhere the machine identifies each character in the image .\n\nAfter the documents are digitized important information has to be identified . This metadata extraction\nand tagging utilizes Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) to tokenize each digitized text and identify\nterms of significant value . Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) is then performed to create a model to\nextract the metadata like well name basin permit operator well classification latitude longitude\nspudding date kelly bushing etc .\n\nFor the images extracted by the digitization process a modified VGG16 neural network is used to\nautomatically classify tables charts stratigraphic chart images maps seismic core samples and\nscanning electron microscope images within each document ( Simonyan ef a . 2014 )\n\nFor the visualization of the images an atDistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( tSNE )\nalgorithm is used to quantify the similarity of each image which has been developed to visualize\nhighdimensional datasets and reveal clustering within the datasets ( van der Maaten ef al . 2008 ) .\n\nThe output from the machine learning sequence is then exposed to the users through the platform to\nease the work of identifying important information and perform analysis in a more efficient way . The\nextracted information is outputted in an agnostic format which can be efficiently loaded to other\nplatforms or used as is i.e . X Y or LatitudeLongitude formation tops in csv or excel format\ndigitized maps as shapefile for loading into GIS software .\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nWells provide key information about the subsurface in oil and gas exploration and production but at a\nsubstantial cost . As this valuable information associated with a well is often stored as unstructured\ndata it is difficult to do further analysis or apply additional artificial intelligence processing to the\nwell database to enable geoscientists to gain new insights and extract new relationships .\n\nThe carefully selected sequence of machine learning algorithms in the workflow deals with these\nlarge unstructured datasets is housed within a hybrid cloud platform to automatically extract relevant\ninformation within technical documents and convert the unstructured data into a shareable structured\ndataset .\n\nReferences\n\nSimonyan K. 4 Zisserman A . 2014 : Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Largescale Image\nRecognition . arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1556\n\nvan der Maaten L.J.P . 8 Hinton G.E . 2008 : Visualizing HighDimensional Data using tSNE .\nJournal of Machine Learning Research 9 25762605 .\n\nFirst EAGEPESGB Workshop on Machine Learning\n2930 November 2018 London UK", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8047, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"29d24c4c-54d4-4987-8013-122980f4574c": {"doc_hash": "881ee05abe9e15d14da737211e52c23889eb99fd6ba9e0a380ce693c9cf57564", "ref_doc_id": "394a099a-cafc-407d-8b60-8c251cb9fa01"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"394a099a-cafc-407d-8b60-8c251cb9fa01": {"node_ids": ["29d24c4c-54d4-4987-8013-122980f4574c"], "metadata": {"title": "An Automated Information Retrieval Platform For Unstructured Well Data Utilizing Smart Machine Learning Algorithms Within A Hybrid Cloud Container", "author": ["N.M.
