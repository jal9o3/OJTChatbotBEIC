Renewable energy systems\nfor solar hydro and wind need to be built to support the transition . Among the many metals critical to\ntechnology and infrastructure necessary for new energy copper is highly sought after thanks to its\nconductive efficiency making it an irreplaceable element of any electrical equipment . Therefore it is\nprojected that by 2050 the demand for copper will reach more than 53 million metric tons . This is\nmore than all the copper consumed in the world between 1900 and 2021 . Given the above copper\nprice spikes and copper supply challenges are to be expected ( Bonakdarpour a Bailey 2022 ) . Hence\nit is crucial to optimize the way copper is mined in order to meet future demands accelerate the energy\ntransition and execute the plans of stakeholders to achieve Environmental Social and Corporate\nGovernance ( ESG ) targets .\n\nOptimization of copper mining exploration and operations starts with the capability to easily make\ndecisions and gain insights using the organizations data . However this data is often unstructured\nscattered and unsearchable . To extract manage and sustainably utilize all these unstructured data a\ndigital data factory composed of an orchestration of Machine Learning ( ML ) pipelines data tracking\nand monitoring services has been implemented on a subset of data from the Geological Survey of\nQueensland ( GSQ ) in Australia . Utilizing the MLbased Data factory approach this paper highlights\nhow mining information from the GSQ can be analyzed unlocked and used in optimizing the various\nstages of the copper mining operation such as exploration mining operation copper ore processing\nreclamation and safety health and environmental control .\n\nMethodology\n\nUnstructured data from the GSQ contains scientific reports borehole completion reports publications\njournals mining datasets map collections and mining records . The documents are highly technical and\nspread over decades of mining operations making manual human interpretation and data extraction\nchallenging . The dataset covers 62 years of mining operation in Queensland and has been ingested in\nthe data factory at a rate of 3000 pages and 4000 images per day through its scalable automated ML\npipeline and big data capabilities . The steps of the processing include uploading the data to the cloud\naudit of the data textimage extraction image classification and table export capabilities as seen in\nFigure 1 . The features of this MLbased data factory transform voluminous unstructured data into\nstructured data that are readily accessible through a cloudbased application for text image and\nknowledge search . The data factorys features have applications that can be extended to all copper\nmining stages .\n\n10M 7\npperQUArtZ tre\neLsayMineral P :\n\nco\n\nSearch Table OCR Image classification Word Cloud\n\nFigure 1 Transversal corpus search features of the digital data factory .\nSeamless Search Tool\n\nTo have a firm grasp of the copper resource information covering the definitions inferences\nindications and compiled measurements geologists and mining professionals involved in the\n\n84M EAGE Annual Conference 4x Exhibition\n\n-----Page 2-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\nVIENNA AUSTRIA\n\nexploration stage of the copper mining projects would need to be able to gain new insights and search\nthrough their unstructured data ( OceanaGold Corporation 2022 ) . The ingestion and digestion process\nmakes it possible to obtain new knowledge and insights which is very difficult to achieve from the\noriginal unstructured data . The ingested data is run through a Machine Learningbased pipeline that\ntransforms the unstructured data into structured data with its elements made searchable ( Mamador et\nal . 2020 ) . With the seamless search geological mineral and deposit information can be found\nefficiently and fresh insights into the site mineralogy can be gained with relative ease ( Maver et al .\n2021 ) .\n\nCopper mineral deposit models can be correlated to their appropriate locations on geological maps and\nsupported by visual evidence such as mineralogy descriptions in drill hole cores and geological maps\nas displayed in Figure 2 . Solid geological inferences can be made regarding the characteristics of the\ncopper ore deposit which can then lead to feasible drilling and productive mining plans supported by\nowned data .\n\nA\n\nFigure 2 Findings from deep corpus search of copper resource models and new geological insights\nacross Queensland .\n\nFile Domain and Image Tagging\n\nFile domain and image tagging are performed through the data factory . This allows for the\nconsolidation of unstructured data breaking data silos across documents and disciplines and making\nall the relevant data during the copper mining operation accessible across organizations and contractors\nhence streamlining mining workflows and supporting crosscompany collaboration ( Maver et al . 2021 ) .\n\nAn ongoing copper mining operation would continuously produce various figurative and imagery data\nsuch as resources and machinery management schedules rainfall land survey information engineering\nsolutions geology and more . Some if not all of these will be integrated or considered in the mining\nplan or model ( OceanaGold Corporation 2022 ) .\n\nThe continuous aggregation by domain experts and ingestion of unstructured data that happens during\nthis stage of operation are improved via machine learning processes and scaled suitably . This is\nparticularly useful to track reassess visualize and evaluate the mining plans or mining models at\nvarious copper mining stages such as tracking the progress of specific subblocks at a particular time .\nInformation from various sources would be integrated or correlated with these mining plans or models\nto support decisionmaking associated with the site as shown in Figure 3 . This process facilitates not\nonly efficient and easy problemsolving conditions but supports planning processes and governance\nstructures to be databased and able to respond to ESG opportunities risks and challenges ( Maver et\nal . 2021 ) .\n\n84t EAGE Amual Conference 4c Exhibition\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\nVIENNA AUSTRIA\n\nFigure 3 Important documents and varying information concerning the mining model at different\nscales are accessible by various roles ( mining engineers operators surveyors geologists etc . ) across\nthe organization involved .\n\nTable extraction\n\nEngineering geoscience and even metallurgic processes at the copper processing plant produce a vast\nwealth of tables and numerical data ( OceanaGold Corporation 2022 ) . Classifying tables to a particular\nimage group is also tracked by the data factory . Optical character recognition ( OCR ) is used to identify\nand locate individual and specific information which can be used in further analyses . By automatically\nconverting each table image to a .csv file valuable information becomes easily available searchable\nand aggregated across various mining operation stages or copper processing plant processes as shown\non Figure 4 . Manual translation of the table to a .csv file can therefore be avoided and information\ntracked to the original location in the report .\n\nTonnage Copper Silver Indium\n( Mt ) ( 86 ) ( @ 0 )\n\nINDICATED 0.826 ki 96\n\nClassification\n\nINFERRED 0.004\n\nTOTAL\n\nFigure 4 Table image with numerical values such as tonnage and ore grades identified by the data\nJactorys OCR and extracted for external documents .\n\nBeing able to extract numerical values from tables is valuable to help track mining information such as\nore grades tonnage production values coordinates rainfall work hours processing plant or laboratory\nparameters .\n\nMapping of Similar Files and Word Cloud\n\nA data factory contains multiple tools that facilitate rapid comprehension and understanding of the\ncontext of the data .
