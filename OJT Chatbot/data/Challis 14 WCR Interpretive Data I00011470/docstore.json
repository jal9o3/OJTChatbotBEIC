The proposed total depth of\n1674mRT was prognosed to be within the Triassic Pollard Formation of the Sahul\nGroup .\n\nChallis14 was designed primarily as a new drainage location for the north eastern part\nof the Challis horst to develop the C3.23.3 reservoir . The well intersected all\nsedimentary sequences as prognosed with only minor depth variances .\n\nTwo cores were cut from the interval 1393.6 1423.5mRT at the top of the Challis\nFormation with very good recoveries ( 9826 Core1 and 9696 Core2 ) .\n\nA gross hydrocarbon column from 1401 1434.5mRT was intersected extending over .\nthe C3.23.3 sand and the top two metres of the C4.0 sand . The well has a total net\npay of 22.5m average porosity of 2996 and average water saturation of 3896 .\n\nThe well was completed as an oil producer and the rig was released on 5th March\n1994\n\n70920.WCR\nDecember 1994\n\n-----Page 8-----\n\nChallis14 Well Completion Report Interpretive Volume . 4\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\nHYDROCARBONS\nHydrocarbon Occumences\n\nThere was no direct hydrocarbon fluorescence or significant gas readings in the\nTertiary and Cretaceous sections .\n\nDitch gas readings rose to about 1096 consisting of C1iC4 over the 1400 1420mRT\nsection . Below this depth the background gas reduced to between 0.010.295\nconsisting dominantly of C1 .\n\nCore chips from 1393.6 1423.7mRT show 9010096 bright greenish yellow direct\nfluorescence with instant moderately bright yellowish white cut and a solid very bright\nyellow residual fluorescence .\n\nLog interpretation ( Appendix N carried out over the interval 1350 1664mRT revealed .\nthat the C3.2C3.3 sand was encountered five metres lower than prognosed at 1398m\nand was 21 metres thick ( cf . prognosed 20m ) . The C4.0 C5.0 CS . 15.2 C6.0 and\nPollard Formation were 8 also intersected by Challis14\n\nAn oil water contact is interpreted at 1434.5m intersecting in an upper stringer of the\nC4.0 sand . This oil water contact is 2.5m higher than the original field wide contact of\n1437m and it is likely that this reservoir unit is hydraulically isolated from the C4.0\nperforation in Challis6 ( C4.0 producer ) . 8 The observed rise in the oil water contact is\nlikely to be due to Challis6 production from the C4.0 sand which is currently\nproducing with 7596 water cut .\n\nThe gross hydrocarbon column ( 1401 1434.5mRT ) extends over the C3.23.3 sand\nand into the top two metres of the C4.0 sand with a total net pay of 22.5m average\nporosity of 2946 and water saturation of 3896 .\n\nFrom RFT pretest data ( refer Appendix 2 ) an oil gradient of 1.01 psim was observed\ndown to 1410.5m . The fluid in the C5.0 C5.15.2 and Pollard sands was shown to be\nwater with varying degrees of depletion from the original reservoir conditions .\nDepletion was greatest in the C4.0 sand mainly due to the fact that Challis6 is closer\nto Challis14 than other producers .\n\nNo RFT samples were attempted nor was production testing carried out . PLT surveys\ncarried out show the following results :\n\n( 4 ) a final PI of 70stbpsi was measured\n\n( ii ) 8 temperature logs indicated flow contributions from C3.2C3.3 reservoir at\ninterval 1403 1409mRT and a stringer sand at 1415 1417mRT\n\n( iii ) 8 gas break out occurred at 1160 1450psia and the likely bubble point pressure\nof 1160psia of 64.9C was estimated .\n\nThe PLT report is presented in Appendix 3\n\nT0920.WcR\nDecember 1994\n\n-----Page 9-----\n\nChallis14 Well Completion Report Interpretive Volume 5\n4 .

The core was extremely unconsolidated and had to be\nfrozen before plugs could be taken . The results of the core analysis are therefore\nunlikely to be representative of reservoir characteristics as the freezing will have\nsignificantly altered the state of the core . Measured core porosities and\npermeabilities are expected to be higher than original values .\nAs the quality of the core was in doubt no overburden pressure tests were conducted\non the core .\n2.2 Sidewall Cores\nNo sidewall cores were taken in Challis14\n2.3 Logs Run\nThe Sperry Sun MWD tool was used while drilling Challis14 to collect gamma ray\ndirectional and resistivity data .

The fluid in the C5.0 CS.15.2 and Pollard sands was shown to be water with\nvarying degrees of depletion from the original reservoir conditions . The C4.0 sand\nshowed the greatest amount of depletion which is consistent with the fact that the\nC4.0 producer ( Challis6 ) is closer to Challis14 than the other producers . The C4.0\npretest data indicates that the sand is predominantly water bearing but the fluid in\nthe top two metres of the sand ( 1432.51434.5 m ) can not be conclusively identified\nfrom the RFT information .\n\nRefer to the Challis14 RFT Report for further details .\nProduction Testing\n\nNo production testing was carried out in this well .\n\nOur Ref : 20:1685:00 20 May 1994\nFile No : Cha14PP ! 901R\n\n-----Page 24-----\n\nChallis14 Log Interpretation Report\n\n3 ...

RESULTS\n5.1 Discussion of Interpretation Results\n\nEnclosure 1 is a plot of the computed interpretation for the reservoir section in\nChallis14 .\n\nThe gross hydrocarbon column ( 14011434.5 m ) extends over the C3.23.3 sand and\ninto the top two metres of the C4.0 sand . The oil water contact is masked by a shaly\ninterval but there is clearly oil down to 1434.5 m and water up to 1439 m. This is\nconsistent with the original field oil water contact which was at 1410.5 m TVDSS\n( 1437 mRT Sedco708 ) .\n\nThe saturation cutoff used to define net pay is not satisfied in the sand stringers at the\nbase of the C3.23.3 ( Enclosure 1 ) . However the PLT run after the well had been\nperforated between 1395 and 1421 m showed that the sands below 1410.5 m were\ncontributing to flow . It is likely that the interpretation underestimates the oil\nsaturation through this interval because the log responses would have been affected by\nthe washouts .\n\nThe core porosity data is plotted with the interpreted log porosity in Enclosure 2 .\nThe core porosities are approximately 296 higher than the interpreted log porosities\nacross the main oil bearing section ( 1402 141 m ) . Higher core porosities were\nexpected because the core had been frozen ( refer to Section 2.1 ) .\n\n5.2 Summary of Results\nAssuming the following cut offs : Porosity 5 18946\n\nVsh c 5046\nSw 2 10095\n\nDEPTH SAND GROss NET NTG POR\n\n( mRT ) ( m ) SAND ( 24 ) ( 24 ) ( 24 )\n1401 1434.5 Gross HC 33.5 32.5 97 28 48\n\ncolumn\n\n1432.5 C4.0 ( total ) 25 25 100 28 87\n\n1457.5\n\n1432.5 C4.0 ( oil ) 2 2\n\n1434.5\n\n1434.5 C4.0 ( water ) 23 23 28 90\n\n1457.5\n\n\n\n1472.5 C5.0 ( water )\n1497.5\n\nOur Ref : 3c:1685:60 20 May 1994\nFile No : Cha14PPS01R\n\n-----Page 27-----\n\nAssuming the following cut offs : Porosity 5 185\nVsh 2 505\nSw x2 505\n\nDEPTH GROSS NET NTG POR Sy\n( mRT ) ( m ) PAY ( FX ) ( 5 ) ( 5 )\n( m )\n1401 1434.5 Gross HC\n\n13981419 C3.23.3 ( oil )\n1432.5 C4.0 ( total )\n1457.5\n1432.5 CA.0 ( oil )\n1434.5\n1434.5 CA.0 ( water )\n1457.5\n1472.5 C5.0 ( water )\n1497.5\n\n\n-----Page 28-----\n\nbd dents paran is ineralycaleledby the program ing sanda char napo ad Fort ae sis\ndenotes parameters not recognised by the program\n\nParameters used by OPTIMA for the water saturation equation :\n\nR 7 OI6 @ 75R a .00\nR 0.094 @ 75.2F .m 1.80\nR 5 20 n 5 L93\nRow 7 13\n\n-----Page 29-----\n\nG9 BHP\n\nCHALLIS14 RFT REPORT\n\nlad bii\nPREPARED BY : R2 .

In that case the\nC4.0 sand would also be in communication with the above sand units as the\nC4.0 is between the C3.2C3.3 and C5.0 . This is further supported given that\nthe C4.0 had the same depletion as the C3.2C3.3 at the time Challis12 was\ndrilled .\n\nThe Pollard Formation is either not in communication with the Challis\nFormation or any communication is via a tortuous route .\n\nThe C3.2C3.3 sand is not in pressure communication with the C3.0 reservoir .\n\nRFT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe two main objectives of the Challis14 RFT program were as follows :\n\na .\n\nTo determine the reservoir pressures in all penetrated Challis Formation and\nPollard Formation sands .\n\nTo establish the pressure gradient in all sands and identify any wateroil\ncontacts .\n\nRFT PRETEST INTERPRETATION\n\n4.1\n\nAll pretest data are listed in Table 2 . The positions of the pretests are shown\non the iog section ( Figure 2 ) . In all 35 pretests were attempted ( 25 in the\nChallis Formation and 10 in the Pollard Formation ) .\n\nThe pretests designated 30 30A 31 31A and 32 were all taken while POOH\nto establish if the stringer sands in the oil would flow ( ie . had any\npermeability ) . Due to hysteresis effects temperatures and pressures recorded\nat these points were not included in any of the interpretation . Only one of\nthese pretests was successful ( 1396.0 mRT ) however it had little permeability\nas indicated by a drawdown mobility of 47 mDcP .\n\nPressures\nValid formation pressures were recorded on 28 pretests ( Figure 3 ) . All the\n\nsands tested were depleted to varying degrees relative to the original pressures\nmeasured by the Challis1 RFT ( See Section 2.1 Figure 4 ) .\n\nRJ3291:1jCHA13.02.12\n27th May 1994\n\n\n-----Page 34-----\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\nChallis14 RFT Report 3\n\nReservoir Fluid Gradients\n\nNo fluid gradients were calculated . It is highly unlikely the gradients derived\n\nfrom formation pressure data is solely the result fluid pressure . Each sand\n\nintersected by Chailis14 was pressure depleted due to production ( either\ndirectly or via the common aquifer ) from the Chaliis Field .\n\nAs a result of reservoir heterogeneities the pressure depletion of each reservoir\nis unlikely to be uniform ( differential depletion ) and so any fluid gradients\nderived from this data would be a misrepresentation of the true fluid density .\nAlso there is no reason to believe that aquifer composition has changed\n\nsignificantly since the start up of production . The water density should be the\n\nsame as Was established in Challis1 .\n\nC3.2C3.3 Reservoir\n\nFive successful pretests were taken over the interval 1402.5 mRT to 1410.5\n\nmRT ( the C3.2C3.3 sand ) with the open hole logs showing a clean sand with\na high oil saturation . The C3.2C3.3 sand was depleted by approximately 179\npsi indicating that the sand is in communication with other Challis Formation\nproducing reservoirs via the aquifer . The pressure depletion of the C3.2C3.3\nsand indicates it is not in pressure communication with the C3.0 reservoir as\nthis sand is pressure supported via water injection and is currently above\noriginal Challis Field reservoir pressure .\n\nComparing the results of Challis14 with the formation pressures measured by\nChallis12 in the C3.2C3.3 sand ( Figure 5 ) only minor pressure depletion\n( about 7 psi ) has occurred since Challis12 was drilled in July 1992 .\n\nC4.0 Reservoir\n\nTwelve Pretests were attempted over the interval 1433.5 mRT to 1457.0 mRT\n( C4.0 sand ) resulting in ten good tests and two which gave an unrecognisable\nresponse ( three attempts were made to get a good test between 1435.3 mRT\nand 1435.7 mRT ) . The pressure measurements taken in the C4.0 sand implied\nthe C4.0 aquifer was depleted by 320 to 382 psi over the interval tested . If\nthese were true reservoir pressures it implies a further 200 psi ( approximately )\ndepletion since the Challis12 RFT was taken in July 1992 ( Figure 5 ) . At the\ntime of Challis12 the C4.0 reservoir pressure was in line with that measured\nin the C3.2C3.3 sand . Since then the pressures measured by the Challis14\nRFT imply the C4.0 sand has been depleted by a further 200 psi yet only 3655\nof the total fluids produced to date have been withdrawn between the drilling of\nChallis12 and 14 . Given this conflicting data it is almost certain that the\npressure measurements taken over this interval were under the influence of the\ndrawdown from Challis6 which produces the C4.0 reservoir and is only 400\nm to the NE of Challis14 .\n\nRJI3291 : rjCHA1302.12\n27th May 1994\n\n\n-----Page 35-----\n\n4.5\n\n4.6\n\n4.7\n\n4.8\n\nChallis14 RFT Report 4\n\nGiven the almost uniform depletion of the C3.2C33 C5.0 and C5.1C5.2\nsands it is not unreasonable for the unaffected aquifer pressure to be depleted\nby a similar amount . Assuming an average depietion of 170 psi the unaffected\naquifer pressure of the C4.0 in the middle of the sand ( 1445 mRT ) would be\napproximately 1920 psia .\n\nC5.0 Reservoir\n\nTwo successful pretests were taken at 1488.0 mRT and 1496.0 mRT ( C5.0\nsand ) . Both measurements in the sand indicated a reasonably uniform depletion\nof 152 psi from the original Challis1 pressure gradient and from the relative\namount of depletion this sand is in communication with other Challis\nFormation reservoirs via the aquifer .\n\nC5.1C5.2 Reservoir\n\nTwo successful pretests were taken at 1509.0 mRT and 1516.0 mRT\n( C5.1C5.2 sand ) . Both measurements in the sand indicated a reasonably\nuniform depletion of 146 psi from the original Challis1 pressure gradient and\nfrom the relative amount of depletion this sand is in communication with other\nChallis Formation reservoirs via the aquifer .\n\nPollard Formation\n\nFight successful pretests were taken over the.interval 1574.0 mRT to 1649.0\nmRT ( Pollard Formation ) . The formation pressures measured in the Pollard\nindicated a reasonably uniform pressure depletion of 22 psi from the original\nChallis1 pressure gradient . Given the small amount of depietion in this\nformation compared to the depletion in the aquifer of the Challis Formation\n\neither this sand is not in pressure communication with the sands of the Challis\n\nFormation or if they are in communication the pathway must be tortuous .\n\nFluid contacts\n\nNo fluid contacts were observed .\n\nRJ3291 : rjCHA13.02.12\n27th May 1994\n\n\n-----Page 36-----\n\nChallis14 RFT Report\n\nih\n\nS.

Challis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 1\nOPERATIONS SUMMARY\n\nChallis14 was spudded on 6 February 1994 in permit ACIL3 ( Figure 1 ) to develop\nthe C3.2C3.3 sand of the Challis Formation . The well reached a total depth of 1676\nmRT ( 1654 mSS ) on 18 February 1994 . Completion activities commenced on 21\nFebruary 1994 following open hole logs which confirmed the presence of oil bearing\nsands .\n\nFlowback operations commenced at 1830 hours on 27 February 1994 following well\nperforation ( perforated interval 1395 mRT and 1421 mRT ) . A clean up flow back was\nfollowed by : PLT surveys with the well shut in and flowing ( Figure 2 ) . The flow back\nduring the PLT surveys was at a restricted rate as oil production could not be flared\ndue to safety concerns ( as a result of an earlier air compressor fire ) . Completion\nactivities ended on 1 March 1994\n\nChallis14 was reentered for further PLT surveys on 2 March 1994 to confirm flow\ncontribution from the main sand interval ( 1402 mRT to 1411 mRT ) . A total of six\nlogging runs and five well flow periods were completed ( Figure 3 ) . Although\nobtaining a spinner survey across the perforated interval was the main objective of re\nentering the well no surveys were obtained despite five attempts .\n\nThe total volume of oil recovered from all flow periods was 381 sm ?\n\nTable 1 summarises the basic well data .\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n2.1 . A final productivity index of 70 stbdpsi was measured .\n\n2.2 Temperature logs indicated clean up of the main C3.2C3.3 sand with\nsignificant flow contribution from the interval 1403 mRT to 1409 mRT .\n\n2.3 Temperature logs indicated a small flow contribution from the stringer sand at\n1415 mRT to 1417 mRT .\n\n2.4 During the flowing gradient survey conducted during the well reentry gas\nbreak out occurred somewhere in the range 1160 psia to 1450 psia . A most\n\n.likely bubble point pressure of 1160 psia at 64.9 C was estimated from\nstatistical analysis of the data .\n\n25 The temperature anomaly identified in the initial flowback could be interpreted\nas due to flow behind casing prior to perforation .\n\nRJ3293 : rjCHA15.05.02\n27th May 1994\n\n-----Page 51-----\n\nChallis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 2\n\nPRODUCTION LOGGING OBJECTIVES\n\nThe three objectives of the Challis14 initial flowback production logging program\nwere a3 follows :\n\na .\n\nTo obtain a stabilised flow rate and a bottom hoie flowing pressure to enable\nthe calculation of the well productivity index .\n\nTo obtain a qualitative indication of the flow contribution over the perforated\nintervals using temperature .\n\nTo obtain a flowing pressure gradient and gradiomanometer readings to enable\nvertical flow performance modeiling and to identify at what depth gas break out\nOCCUIS .\n\nThe two objectives of the Challis14 well reentry production logging program were as\n\nfollows :\n\na .\n\nTo confirm the flow contributions over the perforated intervals using a fullbore\nspinner .\n\nb . To obtain a stabilised flow rate and a bottom hole flowing pressure to enable\nthe calculation of the well productivity index .\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n4.1 Initial Flowback\n\n4.1.1 Flow Period 1 ( Clean Up )\n\nFollowing perforation at 1830 hours on 27 February 1994 Challis14\nwas flowed to clean up the well . The well was beaned up to a\nmaximum liquid rate of 665 sm ? d on a choke setting of 19 mm . The\nwell was shut in at 2115 hours with 17 sm of oil recovered at surface\n( Figure 4 ) .\n\n4.1.2 PLT Run l\n\nThree PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were conducted over the perforated\ninterval ( 1395 mRT to i421 mRT ) . Challis14 was opened at 0214\nhours on 28 February 1994 with the oil rate restricted to approximately\n120 sm ? d for the majority of the flow period as it was decided not to\nflare due to safety concerns ( the concerns arose after a small fire on one\nof the air compressors ) . Production was shut in at 0400 hours\nfollowing the completion of the PLT surveys ( Figure 5 ) . A total of 7\nsm ? of oil was recovered at surface during the flow period .\n\nRJ3293 : rjCHA15.05.02\n27th May 1994", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45474, "end_char_idx": 50665, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0c8bc37-ee75-4515-ae9d-7cb037f258d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0c8bc37-ee75-4515-ae9d-7cb037f258d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Challis 14 WCR Interpretive Data I00011470", "author": ["D.

These are indicated by the\ninflections in the temperature gradient .\n\nThe majority of the flow must have been eminating from the upper\ninterval because the temperature gradient is flatter above the interval\nthan below it ( indicating there is a greater specific heat ie greater\nflow above the interval than below ) .\n\nThis was confirmed by the static temperature profile taken 2 days later\n( Figure 10 ) showing the well had cooled off more above the interval\nthan below it and by the flowing gradient survey ( Figure 8 ) . The\nsurvey showed an oil gradient above 1405 mRT and completion brine\nbelow which would indicate that any flow below 1405 mRT was\ninsufficient to lift the completion brine .\n\nThe temperature logs also showed an slightly hotter anomaly in the\nwelibore between approximately 1408 mRT and 1419 mRT ( Figure 6 ) .\nThe maximum deviation from the underlying wellbore temperature\ngradient was 2 C at 1413 mRT . Over this interval the main sand\n( 1402 mRT to 1411 mRT ) of the C3.2C3.3 reservoir is separated from\nthe lower sand stringers by a shalier section ( 1411 mRT and 1415\nmRT ) . One explanation for the anomaly could be cross flow behind\ncasing ( prior to well perforation ) heating this shale above the\ngeothermal gradient as illustrated in the schematic in Figure 7 . This\ninterpretation is based on two assumptions :\n\ni ) The sand stingers below the main sand were isolated and at the\noriginal reservoir pressure ( these sand stringers were not tested\nduring the RFT survey ) .\n\nii ) The cement bond between the main sand and the lower sand\nstringers was poor . The CBL showed a poor cement bond\nhowever the CET suggested this was due to a micro annulus .\n\nFrom the RFT survey the main sand was shown to be depleted by 180\npsi from the original reservoir pressure . If the sand stringers were at\noriginal reservoir pressure and the cement bond poor flow from the\nsand stringers to the main sand would have occurred for up to seven\ndays before the well was perforated .\n\nRJ3293 : rjCHA15.05.02\n27th May 1994\n\n-----Page 53-----\n\nChallis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 4\n\nThis interpretation is further supported by the flowing gradient survey\nconducted over the perforations ( Figure 8 ) . The derived fluid density\nbelow 1405 mRT was comparable to the completion brine ( 1.13 SG @\n207C ) . This suggests very little or no flow below this point ( if the\nperforations were flowing it was insufficient to lift the brine ) and poor\nclean up of the main C3.2C3.3 sand . With flow coming from well\nabove the region of the anomaly there would be very little heat\ndissipated in the few hours between perforation and logging the well .\n\nThe temperature anomaly disappeared after a second clean up flow\nwhen the well was reentered two days later ( see Section 4.2.6 )\n\nA flowing gradient survey was performed while POOH ( Figure 9 ) . The\nchange in gradient indicating gas break out was very subtle . A most\nlikely bubble point pressure of 1120 psia at 48.6 C was estimated based\non statistical analysis of the data .\n\n42 Well ReEntry\n\n4.2.1\n\n4.2.2\n\nTool Performance\n\nA spinner survey across the perforations was the main objective of the\nwell reentry . Five unsuccessful attempts were made . During each the\nPLT run the spinner response was lost before reaching the perforations .\nTwo spinners types were used ( a fullbore for the first four PLT runs Ai\nand an inline on the final run ) however this made no difference . On\neach occasion only temperature and strain gauge pressure were\nsurveyed . The gradiomanometer and HP gauge could not be repaired\nand were not replaced after the initial flowback operations .\n\nThe problems with obtaining a spinner response were initialiy thought to\nbe hole related . Following the first two PLT runs material fibres were\nfound on the tool string at surface ( the material fibres were wrapped\naround the fullbore spinner blades following the first run ) . However\nthere was no obvious cause for the loss of spinner response following\nthe latter three runs as the spinner functioned normaliy when returned to\nsurface . The PLT surveys conducted on the next well ( Skua3 )\nsuggested the problem may have resuited from the defective .\ngradiomanometer . The response from the spinner is amplified through\nthis tool . Logging runs on Skua3 with a CPLT tool resulted in\nsuccessful spinner surveys\n\nCCL Survey\n\nA CCL survey on high gain was conducted in an attempt to confirm the\nperforated interval . No perforations were identified by the survey .\n\nRJ3293 : rjCHA15.05.02\n21th May 1994\n\n\n-----Page 54-----\n\n4.2.3\n\nChallis14 Completion Flowback PLT Report 5 .\nPLT Run 1\n\nThis run was the first # ttempi at spinner calibration and to check for\ncross flow with the well shut in . Two PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were\nconducted over the perforated interval ( 1395 mRT to 1421 mRT ) . A\n\n. Static pressure measurement of 1852 psia was obtained at 1390 mRT\n\n4.2.4\n\n4.2.5\n\n4.2.6\n\nwith the well shut in .\n\n: The temperature logs still showed a hotter anomaly in the wellbore\n\nbetween approximately 1408 mRT and 1419 mRT however the\nmaximum deviation from the underlying wellbore temperature gradient\nhad reduced from the 2 C recorded two days earlier to approximately\n0.4 C at 1416 mRT ( Figure 10 ) .\n\nPLT Run 2\n\nNo surveys were conducted during this run . This was the second\nattempt at spinner calibration and to check for cross flow with the well\nshut in . The tool was POOH when the spinner response was lost .\n\nFlow Period 1 ( Clean Up )\n\nFollowing the initial flowback and the first PLT run of the well re\nentry it was evident that Challis14 had not completely cleaned up .\nThe well was opened at 2132 hours on 2 March 1994 and beaned up to\na maximum liquid rate of 1168 sm3d on a choke setting of 25 mm .\nThe well was shut in at 2320 hours with 60 sm ? of oil recovered at\nsurface ( Figure 11 ) .\n\nPLT Run 3\n\nTwelve PLT surveys ( Table 2 ) were conducted over the perforated\ninterval ( 1395 mRT to 1421 mRT ) . Challis14 was opened at 0128\nhours on 3 March 1994 and beaned up to a maximum oil production\nrate of 1114 sm ? d . Production was shut in at 0652 hours following the\ncompletion of the PLT surveys ( Figure 12 ) . A total of 213 sm of oil\nwas recovered at surface during the flow period .\n\nThe flowing bottom hole pressure was monitored between surveys . A\nfinal static pressure measurements of 1762.1 psia was obtained at 1395\nmRT with the well flowing at 1052 sm3d .\n\nThe temperature logs indicated the main C3.2C3.3 sand had cleaned\nupwith the major contribution to flow coming from between 1403 mRT\nand 1409 mRT . The temperature logs also indicated a smaller\ncontribution to flow from the sand stringer between 1415 mRT and\n1417 mRT ( Figure 13 ) . The temperature anomaly observed in previous\nsurveys had disappeared following the earlier clean up flow period\n( Figure 14 ) .\n\nRJ3293 : rjCHA15.05.02\n27th May 1994", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50668, "end_char_idx": 58070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "696d2c1e-4abc-410e-bba3-95939ad6329f": {"__data__": {"id_": "696d2c1e-4abc-410e-bba3-95939ad6329f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Challis 14 WCR Interpretive Data I00011470", "author": ["D.

The high core and wire line log gamma ray response in an\napparently well sorted sandstone facies indicates the presence of hot detrital minerals\nwithin this interval . The interval 1393.92 m to 1395.40 m is interpreted as a stacked\nsuccession of crevasse splay cycles deposited in a lower coastal plain setting . The\nabundance of shaly flaser drapes contributes to the high gamma ray response over this\ninterval . The interval 1395.40 m to 1397.25 m is interpreted as overbank or abandoned\nchannel fili deposited ih a lower coastal plain setting . The intensity of bioturbation\nindicates brackish water or even more open marine influence perhaps in a delta fringe\nsetting . The presence of rootlet structures in the upper third of the interval may\nindicate a colonised levee bank palaeosol . The interval 1397.25 m to 1400.00 m is\ninterpreted as a possible distal crevasse splay interval deposited during the early stage\nof a channel abandonment cycle within a high sinuosity lower coastal plain fluvial\nsystem . The presence of minor small burrows indicates at least a brackish water\ninfluence during sedimentation .\n\nThe interval 1400.00 m to 1400.35 m is interpreted as an upward fining point bar\nchannel cycle which gives way to channel abandonment in the overlying interval . The\ninterval 14.35 m to 1409.40 m is an aggradational succession of individual lower to\nmiddle point bar channel units separated by scour surfaces . Trough cross bedding\ncharacterises deposition within the lower point bar channel while current ripple or\nflaser laminations characterise the waning energy of the middle point bar . The absence\nof the upper point bar abandonment cycle indicates deposition during late flood to\nearly falling stage within a low sinuosity fluvial system . No burrows or other marine\nor brackish water indicators are evident and the interval is interpreted as a significant\nfluvial discharge into a more generally marine influenced lower coastal plain setting .\n\nThe interval 1409.40 m to 1409.83 m is interpreted as a middle point bar tidal channel\nunit as evidenced by the basal scour and the presence of flasers and bioturbation .
