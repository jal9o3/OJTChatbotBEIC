C to reduce the impact of climate change :\nGlobal warming reaching 1.5 ? C in the nearterm would cause unavoidable increases in multiple\nclimate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans ( very high confidence ) . ... Near\nterm actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5 ? C would substantially reduce projected losses\nand damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems compared to higher warming\nlevels but can not eliminate them all ( very high confidence ) . ( IPCC 2022 ) .\n\nIn addition the AR6 report linked to Climate Change 2022 : Mitigation of Climate Change suggests\nthat All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5C ... involve rapid and deep and in\nmost cases immediate GHG emission reductions in all sectors . Modelled mitigation strategies to\nachieve these reductions include transitioning from fossil fuels without CCS to very low or zerocarbon\n\nenergy sources such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS demand side measures and improving\nefficiency reducing nonCO emissions ( IPCC 2022 ) .\n\n1 1 Our World\nGlobal primary energy consumption by source\nPrimary energy is calculated based on the substitution method which takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil\nfuel production by converting nonfossil energy into the energy inputs required if they had the same conversion\nlosses as fossil fuels\n\nOther\nrenewables\nModern biofuels\nSolar\n\nWind\nHydropower\nNuclear\n\nGas\n\n160000 TWh\n\n140000 TWh\n\n120000 TWh\n\n100000 TWh\n\n80000 TWh Oil\n\n60000 TWh\n40000 TWh\n\nCoal\n\n20000 TWh\n\nTraditional\nbiomass\n\nOTWh\n1800 1850 1900 1950 2019\n\nSource : Vaclav Smil ( 2017 ) 4 BP Statistical Review of World Energy OurWorldInData.orgenergy CC BY\n\n84t EAGE Amual Conference 4c Exhibition\n\n-----Page 2-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\nVIENNA AUSTRIA\n\nFigure 1 : Global primary energy consumption by source . Fossil energies account for 8076 respectively\nCoal ( 2590 ) Oil ( 3206 ) and Gas ( 2396 ) ( Source : Our World in Data Energy )\n\nWhile limiting the reduction of CO : to reduce the impact of climate change the world is still highly\ndependent on fossil fuels with fossil energies accounting in 2019 for more than 80X44 in total and OilGas\nfor 6070 alone ( Figure 1 ) . Combined with the need of powering the world and the challenges of climate\nchange the energy sector has a central play to significantly monitor and reduce its CO ? footprint .\n\nCarbon accounting\n\nCarbon accounting is the process which allows organization to quantify and monitor Greenhouse Gas\n( GHG ) emissions . By construction carbon accounting counts the direct and indirect emissions linked\nto the activity of the organization through the full value chain .\n\nDirect emission are the emissions directly related to the own activity of the company such as oilgas\nextraction and production and are often referred to scope 1 emissions . Indirect emission are the\nemissions emitted considering the full value chain . In the case of the energy industry this would\nconsider all the necessary services contracted to perform the extraction of oil and gas from the\nsubsurface and all the emissions related to the usage of the oil and gas as a molecule for the human\nusage in mobility industry usage and heat generation . These emissions are falling into the scope 2\nassociated to the supply of energy ( input ) and the scope 3 linked to the oil and gas products sold ( output ) .\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the breakdowns and evolution of four ( 4 ) representative Oil major operators\nemissions until 2018 . In average 1076 of the emissions are associated to direct emission and 9075 of\nthem are linked to indirect emissions connected to hydrocarbon products sold . Considering oil and gas\ncommitment in reducing carbon emission this means that both direct and indirect emissions would need\nto be tackled simultaneously .\n\nOil Majors Carbon emissions\n\nEmissions from oil and gas products sold ( Scope 3 ) far exceed emissions from oil and gas production and refining operations ( Scope 12 )\n\nOperator A Operator B\n800 800\n\nM scope3 M scope 3\n\n600 Car29n 600 Gan\nScope2 Scope2\n400 00\n200 200\n0 0\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\nOperator C Operator D\n\nW scope 3\n\nB Scope 3\noo 400\n600 Scope1 Scope1\nScope2 300 Scope2\n400\n200\n200\n100\n0 0\n2010 2012 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 pini 018\n\n2014 2010 2018\n\nFigure 2 : Evolution of direct and indirect emissions for four ( 4 ) Oil Majors . scope 1 : Own operations\n( direct emissions ) scope 2 : Power supply ( indirect emissions ) scope 3 : Indirect from oil and gas\nproducts sold ( indirect emissions ) ( Source : Modified from Reuters 2019 )\n\nData mining technology\n\n84M EAGE Annual Conference 4x Exhibition\n\n-----Page 3-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\nVIENNA AUSTRIA\n\nDecades of oil and gas operations associated to the exploration development and production of oil\nfields have generated vast amount of data which provides a deep insight of constant optimization of\ncosts and resources . The data are interpreted and compiled into unstructured data such as reports\npresentations and studies providing a carbon copy of the history of the operations . The unstructured\ndata provides an immense potential of CO emissions reduction for both direct and indirect emissions .\nNew technology such as Data Mining and Machine Learning technology helps to process and retrieve\ninformation at scale contained in the unstructured data in a pipeline called ingestion of unstructured\ndata ( Hernandez 2019 ) . The process involves automated pipeline of text identification image\nclassification Name Entity Recognition ( NER ) Knowledge Graph and Heat Map analysis .\n\nFor the direct emissions the ingestion of unstructured data gives the GKG experts a discovery\nexperience allowing him to interrogate the full corpus of data instantly .
