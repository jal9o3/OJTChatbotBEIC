Conventional areal studies for sand production will only be limited to few wells and heavily\ndependent on data availability humanbased interpretation and time constraints . To administer a\nholistic basin study for sand production comprising of hundreds of wells with conventional manual\nmethod is considered complex and time consuming hence sand mitigation best practices are typically\nderived from localized reservoir and production engineering data only and knowledge is organically\nbuilt through accumulated expert experience in the area over multiple years of operatorship . Information\nand reports may be derived from millions of pages of legacy well reports documentations or files from\nover 40 years ranging from digitized medium to handwritten reports in countless formats .\n\nA sustainable strategy of datadriven basis shall be leveraged to address the knowledge and information\nmanagement issues utilizing the latest advancement of Machine Learning ( ML ) and data analytics to\nmaximize the potential of unstructured data . Utilizing the intuitive datadriven approach the paper will\nhighlight the areal causation of sand production based on geological characteristics and the best\npractices of sand control commenced by 8 operators in Norwegian Basins practically informative for\nfuture exploration wells to be developed nearby current wells . The study first creates a relationship\nbetween the causation of sand production versus the sand control practices implied and best practices\nare derived from the practices of multiwells .\n\nMethodology\n\nUnstructured data in nature is significantly sophisticated to be manually interpreted and skimmed\nthrough by humanintervention . An intuitive approach embedded with Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork ( DCNN ) for autonomous image recognition and Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) for texts\nand entity processing and recognition has been a pioneering enterprisescaled platform in managing\nunstructured data ( Hernandez et al . 2019 ) . It will be capable to ingest big data for the case study\ncomprising of 70000 files with 490000 pages and 430000 images inclusive of 361 wells over 5 basins\nin Norway . 40 years of unstructured data for sand production case study is consolidated approximately\nwithin 16 days of study period .\n\nCorrelate findings with\nKnowledge Graph\n\nP Image search module\nLithology tab o plotsimagesmapsstratigraphic\nplots\n\nF : 1\n\nFigure 1 Datadriven case study research strategy for sand production in Norwegian Basins .\n\n84t EAGE Amual Conference 4c Exhibition\n\n-----Page 2-----\n\nEAGE ANNUAL\n\nVIENNA AUSTRIA\n\nStep ( 1 ) is a generic deep search of the sand production scope across the whole corpus . Step ( 2 ) leads\nto discovering all wells significant parameters based on the files search results within well summary\ntab . Step ( 3 ) portrays an early insight of the general idea of the document with word cloud . Step ( 4 ) heat\nmap resembles the wells distribution in a GIS map based on colour density of corpus search frequency\nmentioned in the documents . To uncover more questions along the research process and to obtain more\nindepth information step ( 5 ) is conducted in an iterative manner . Step ( 6 ) is to relate the lithology\ndistribution by lithology count within each well document to the previous detailed search parameters .\nStep ( 7 ) aims to find more representable images to support the case study through the automatically\nclassified images through DCNN in the reports . After all significant parameters are obtained wellto\nwell relationship is studied to get more details on further causation and best practices of sand production\nmanagement .\n\nThe features of this intuitive knowledge management platform transform voluminous unstructured data\ninto structured data that are ready to be consumed and utilised for production enhancement case study .\nFour main ML analytical tools embedded in the platform are as presented below ( Baillard et al.2021 ) :\n\ne Expeditious and intelligent search module by keywordbasis searching through hundreds of\nthousands of pages of texts and texts embedded inside images .\n\ne Autonomous extraction of images from documents and image segregation into respective image\nclasses of tables figures well plots and maps with DCNN image detection algorithm .\n\ne Knowledge graph with contextual well name relationship portraying connectivity of related\ncorpuses to understand welltowell relationship as described in their respective document corpus .\n\ne Heat Map illustrates the density of keywords by colour gradient on wells based on the search results\non a map . Polygonal or square filter feature enable selective wells to be screened out for users\nnarrowed search interest .\n\nCase Study : Preliminary Study on Sand Production and Developing Sand Control Benchmark of\nNorwegian Basin with Unstructured Data\n\nThe study was conducted extensively throughout approximately 361 wells consuming16 days of study\nperiod covering the analysis and interpretation of sand production trends causation and best practices\nin Norwegian Basins .

However a few wells do highlight these characteristics but no\nor little sanding occurred and assumptions were made that intergrain cementation are intact or sanding\nprobably will occur soon in the later phases of the reservoir as sand production onset is distinct in each\nwell . Perforation design does not lead primarily towards sand production as comparison has been made\nfor wells with the same perforation shots with significantly different reservoir parameters for\ncomparative analysis . Pore pressure abnormalities attained from Knowledge Graph module possibly\ncauses sand production problems specifically reported in well 2555 and 2563 within Heimdal\nformation interval leading to depleted pressure gradient trends in both wells . Analysing the causation\nof sanding creates an understanding in relation to the sand control practices conducted for each of the\nwells . Wells describing sand production issues sand control mitigation methods and other relatable\ndescriptions of sand production were intensively analysed as Figure 4 above .\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging unstructured data into an intuitive structured data with embedded endtoend ML\nadvanced technology made it possible to interpret analyze and make decisions with regards to\nhandling big data and derive sand production causation and best practices across 490000\npages of public documents inclusive of 361 wells and 2 Norwegian basins in total . The novel\napproach serves as a holistic study of sand management focused on unstructured big data\nwhich combines multiple digitalization techniques currently applied in the petroleum industry .\nMaximizing the potential of underutilized unstructured data leads to opening of vast\nopportunities for enhancement of production in existing oil and gas wells and reduces\ninvestment in the drilling of newer more expensive wells in alignment with a reuse reduce\nupcycle mentality towards sustainable energy transition for the industry .\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis paper utilizes the data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate ( NPD ) open dataset .
