A Case Study of Understanding the Bonaparte Basin using Unstructured Data Analysis with
Machine Learning Techniques

Introduction

The analysis of the (iii) Limited Mineral Composition Understanding, shown in Figure 5, utilizes the
thin section automatically extracted using ML classification over the full area and suggests that:

Quartz overgrowth and kaolinite are quite common in Bonaparte Basin

Mica mineral can be observed at the north-eastern part of the basin

Highly corroded, skeletal feldspar has been extensively dissolved, which forms secondary
porosity, and can be observed in the northern part of the basin

Some patchy siderites are also observed in the southern part of the basin

Introduction

In the upstream oil and gas sector, the processes of data mining, which involves searching, extracting,
